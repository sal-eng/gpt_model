1.1 Canadian Nuclear Beginnings
During the first part of the 20thCentury, significant discoveries were made in the field of nuclear
physics and chemistry, leading to the splitting of the atom and release of energy. Canada
became an important player in the development of nuclear technology during and after World
War II as a result of the Allied war effort to develop the atomic bomb. Although not directly
involved in the development of the bomb, Canada contributed a significant amount of related
nuclear research.
Canadian history in nuclear physics essentially started in 1898 when Ernest Rutherford, a New
Zealand born British scientist, was appointed Professor of Experimental Physics at McGill
University. His early work here was related to radioactivity, and he won a Nobel Prize for this
contribution to scientific knowledge in 1908. One of his students, John Cockcroft, who received
a Nobel Prize jointly with Ernest Walton in 1951, subsequently came to Canada in 1944 to direct
the Montreal Laboratory which had been set up in 1942 as a joint British-Canadian effort. In the
intervening period, much fundamental research had been done, and consideration was then
being given to the design and building of a reactor which would require more extensive labora-
tories to be located at Chalk River.
Concurrent work in the United States had led to the building of the first nuclear reactor, in
which a self-sustaining nuclear reaction took place in 1942. This reactor was built of graphite
blocks in which were distributed lumps of uranium. It was known as a pile due to the method of
construction.
During the war years, emphasis in the United States was directed towards the development of
the atomic bomb. This required highly enriched uranium or plutonium. Whereas the former
required extensive isotope separation facilities, the latter could be created from non-fissile
uranium in a reactor and chemically separated from the spent fuel. There was therefore a
concerted effort in the United States to build suitable reactors. Therefore, after the war, nuclear
research was also directed towards the design of reactors for power production.
After the war, Britain, without enrichment facilities and with no source of heavy water, followed
the route of graphite moderated natural uranium reactors to produce plutonium for nuclear
weapons, while at the same time developing reactors for power production. As a result, Calder
Hall became the first commercial nuclear power plant in the world when the first of four 60
MWe units was connected to the grid on 27 August 1956. It continued to operate until 2003. In
the United States, with uranium enrichment facilities in place, the focus was on the develop-
ment of light water moderated reactors using enriched uranium. Such reactors were highly
suitable for submarine propulsion because the reactors were very compact. Furthermore, the
vessels could remain submerged for extended periods and could operate extensively between
refuellings. The expertise thus developed in steam system components for submarine propul-
sion greatly influenced and facilitated the design of Canadian power reactors. Canada had
supported the war effort by research related to heavy water physics and therefore had the
expertise to direct its efforts into the development of heavy water moderated reactors using
natural uranium as fuel. In summary, each country focused its efforts in different directions
depending upon its relative expertise and resources.
Work in Canada was directed towards use of heavy water as a moderator, and to test the4 The Essential CANDU

tially an aluminum cylinder 2 m in diameter and 2.5 m in height surrounded by blocks of graph-
ite. Uranium metal rods clad in aluminum were hung vertically from the top, and heavy water
could be pumped in slowly at the bottom. ZEEP was completed and went critical on 5 Septem-
ber 1945, with almost exactly the amount of heavy water that had been predicted by theory. It
was the first nuclear reactor to operate outside the United States. This confirmed the design
parameters that would be used for the fuel rod lattice for the first functional reactor, designated
NRX. ZEEP , however, continued to be used in later years for experimental studies of neutron
behaviour.
2Canadian Research Reactors
2.1 Small Research Reactors
The Zero-Energy Experimental Pile or ZEEP , which had an operating power of just 1 W, enabled
tests to be carried out to determine the characteristics of heavy water and uranium lattices. It
was also used to determine the neutron energy spectrum in various regions of a fuel bundle.
A larger version of ZEEP , known as ZED-2, was used for studies of fuel and irradiation effects as
well as a variety of possible lattices for power reactors. Fuel bundle designs from 7-element to
37-element assemblies were tested to determine their performance.
The Pool Test Reactor, or PTR, was constructed, as its name implies, near the bottom of a deep
pool of light water. Because this light water was both moderator and coolant, slightly enriched
uranium had to be used as fuel. This arrangement with an easily accessible core made it possi-
ble to shuttle samples of fuel and other materials in and out of the reactor core to determine
their effect on reactivity as well as to study short term radiation effects on materials.
2.2 The NRX Reactor
The first Canadian nuclear reactor to be designed to operate with a positive power output due
to its generation of excess heat was the NRX. This reactor started operation in 1947 with a
design thermal power rating of 10 MW, which was increased to 42 MW by 1954. At the time of
its construction, it was the most powerful nuclear research reactor in the world and became the
most intense source of neutrons available anywhere. It also suffered one of the first major
nuclear reactor accidents in the world (power excursion to 80 MW and partial core meltdown),
but was rebuilt and restarted within two years. It continued in service until 1993, which was
quite a remarkable achievement for an experimental reactor.
The NRX reactor consisted of a vertical cylindrical aluminum calandria with a diameter of 8 m
and a height of 3 m. The calandria contained the heavy water moderator. The core consisted of
a hexagonal array of approximately 175 tubes with a diameter of 60 mm. These tubes held fuel
elements, control rods, and experimental devices. Of these, 12 held control rods made of steel
tubes containing boron carbide powder. The fuel elements consisted of uranium metal rods 3.1
m in length and 31 mm in diameter sheathed in aluminum. Each was surrounded by an alumi-
num tube through which flowed cooling water from the Ottawa River. An air flow in the gap
between the calandria tube and the coolant tube was maintained to limit heat flow to the
moderator to maintain it at a low temperature.
The key technical parameters for the NRX reactor are given in Table 1. The modern CANDUGenealogy of CANDU Reactors 5

2.3 The NRU Reactor
The National Research Universal (NRU) Reactor was a significantly advanced version of the NRX.
Design was started in 1949 after NRX had been put into operation, and it started self-sustained
operation in 1957, some 10 years after NRX. It was designed for a thermal output of 200 MW
using natural uranium, but was converted to 60 MW using highly enriched uranium in 1964 and
converted again to 135 MW using low enriched uranium in 1991. The NRU supported the
Canadian Neutron Beam Centre and served as a test bed for the development of the CANDU
reactor. Like NRX, it was when built the most powerful source of neutrons in the world and
became the world’s leading supplier of radioactive isotopes. It suffered an accident in 1958
when a fuel rod caught fire on removal from the reactor and caused radioactive contamination
within the building and to a lesser degree on the surrounding site. As with NRX, the NRU was
designed to use natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as moderator, but was cooled by heavy
water. With a view to later commercial power applications, it was designed for on-load refuel-6 The Essential CANDU

3Development of the CANDU Reactor
3.1 The NPD Reactor
The Nuclear Power Demonstration or NPD Reactor was partially modelled on the NRU reactor
and was intended to be the first Canadian nuclear power reactor and a prototype for the
CANDU design. Design work commenced in 1955, with the important components being
designed and fabricated by Canadian General Electric. As a power producer, it had to operate at
high temperatures sufficient to generate steam to drive a power producing turbine. These
requirements presented some unique technical challenges due to the pressures under which
the systems would have to operate. The design electrical output was to be 22 MW. Use of
heavy water as a coolant and on-load refuelling had been proven with the NRU reactor, but the
higher temperatures and pressures had to be accommodated by some significant changes.
Firstly, the fuel was changed from uranium metal to uranium dioxide, which could withstand
higher temperatures and was dimensionally stable over long irradiation periods. Secondly, the
fuel cladding was changed from aluminum to zirconium alloy, which could also withstand higher
temperatures and was corrosion resistant as well as being essentially transparent to neutrons.
Thirdly, the fuel channels rather than the calandria were pressurized, leading to a pressure tube
design rather than a pressure vessel design, and these pressure tubes would be of zirconium
alloy. The pressure tube design led to further considerations to accommodate on-load refuel-
ling. With horizontal pressure tubes rather than vertical tubes as in the NRX and NRU reactors,
the fuel could be made into easily handled bundles which could be pushed in from one end and
recovered from the other during refuelling while the reactor was at full power. Several unique
safety features, such as safety shutdown systems with testability during operation, decay heat
removal by natural circulation after shutdown, and a containment to prevent the release of
radioactive material in the event of an accident, were incorporated. The NPD reactor started
operation in 1962 and was taken out of service in 1987, by which time it had fulfilled its original
purpose as a prototype and would have required re-tubing. It had also been an important
training centre for future CANDU nuclear plant operators.
3.2 Douglas Point
The Douglas Point plant was the first full-scale CANDU nuclear generating station and was built
on the shores of Lake Huron where the Bruce Nuclear Power Complex is now located. The
proposed electrical output was 200 MW, and approval was given in 1959. It was basically a
scale-up of the NPD reactor with similar design and components. It delivered power to the
Ontario Hydro electrical grid system from 1967 until 1984, when replacement of the pressure
tubes became necessary and could not be justified on economic grounds. Valuable experience
was gained on this plant which was subsequently applied to later CANDU nuclear power plants.Genealogy of CANDU Reactors 7

4.1 Commercial Reactor Development
The design of the CANDU reactor began with the Nuclear Power Demonstration (NPD) plant.
Certain parameters had to be established within the constraints of existing technology. Basi-
cally, the reactor had to be fuelled with natural uranium, with heavy water as a moderator. This
required a heterogeneous core arrangement with an array of fuel channels through which
coolant flowed. Initial studies suggested a fuel channel cross section of 50 cm2, which trans-
lated into a standard size fuel channel 3.25 in (83 mm) in diameter. To promote good heat
transfer from the fuel, a modified hexagonal array of 19 rods or elements was chosen. The
minimum spacing between rods based on laboratory testing was determined to be 0.050 in
(1.27 mm). Based on irradiation testing, uranium dioxide was shown to have better dimensional
stability and corrosion resistance than uranium metal at high burnup levels. This choice did,
however, reduce the uranium concentration in the fuel and increased the need for good neu-
tron economy. Zirconium had been selected as fuel cladding due to its corrosion resistance and
low neutron absorption, but the quantity of it around the fuel had to be reduced as much as
possible. Although a cladding thickness of 0.020 in (0.51 mm) was recommended by the tube
supplier, further experimental work led to a thickness of 0.015 in (0.38 mm) and later to 0.013
in (0.33 mm). This resulted in collapsible cladding where the tube wall was compressed onto
the fuel once in service.
A major decision was to adopt a pressure tube design rather than a pressure vessel design to
avoid the difficulty of constructing a sufficiently large vessel for a heavy water moderated
reactor. Zirconium alloy pressure tubes had sufficient neutron transparency to make this
possible. A further major decision was to orient the fuel channels horizontally instead of
vertically to facilitate on-load refuelling. The fuel could be made in the form of bundles which
could be pushed through the channels with no need to link them together. These decisions on
reactor configuration made the CANDU unique with regard to other commercial reactor devel-
opments. Although some were designed with pressure tubes or separate fuel bundles, only the
CANDU has horizontal fuel channels.
With a selected fuel channel length of 4 m, the next question was the optimum number of fuel
bundles. A significant advantage of separate fuel bundles was that the entire fuel channel need
not be refuelled at one time. Low burnup fuel could be retained while new fuel was added. An
analysis of diminishing returns indicated that having more than eight bundles would not yield
any advantage, assuming a cosine neutron flux distribution along the fuel channel. This gave a
fuel bundle length of 50 cm in a 4 m long fuel channel. This translated into a standard fuel
bundle length of 19.5 in (495 mm), which was adopted for future CANDU reactors.
A fuelling machine was required at each end of the fuel channel. One supplied fresh fuel from
one end, while the other received spent fuel at the other end. They had to connect to each fuel
channel in turn and remove and re-insert closure plugs at the beginning and end of the refuel-
ling process. The fuel configuration in the form of separate bundles facilitated the design of
these machines because they did not have to handle a very long fuel assembly. In fact, the
design of the fuel string and machines was dictated by the space available in the rock excava-
tion, which had been dimensioned on the assumption that the reactor would have a vertical
orientation. Of necessity, therefore, the fuelling machines were designed each with a rotating8 The Essential CANDU

was that fuelling could take place from either end of the reactor. Such bi-directional fuelling
made it possible to balance the tendency for flux skewing in a partially refuelled channel by
fuelling in the opposite direction in an adjacent channel. In the NPD design, coolant flowed in
the direction opposite to the fuelling direction, so that the fuel bundles were held in place by
the flow of coolant. This established the characteristic bi-directional coolant flow in CANDU
reactors.
The calandria vessel and calandria tubes were of aluminum. Initially, there was no spacer
between the calandria tubes and the fuel channel pressure tube, but as the design for Douglas
Point evolved, a single spacer in the form of an Inconel wire garter spring was introduced. This
enabled the pressure tubes to withstand the effect of creep sag. The calandria had a light water
neutron reflector surrounding it in a radial direction. To bring about a shutdown, the heavy
water moderator could be rapidly drained into a dump tank, which for a small reactor was an
effective way of ensuring safe shutdown in the event of an accident.
The heat transport system which removed heat from the reactor core and generated steam in a
steam generator required pumps to circulate the coolant. Originally, completely enclosed
canned pumps were proposed, but these were later changed to conventional vertical pumps
with shaft seals. These had the advantage of being able to incorporate a flywheel to provide
increased rotational inertia, which would extend the rundown period after a power failure and
enable extra core cooling during the initial stages of high decay heat. The steam generator
design was based on those being designed for United States nuclear submarines. It consisted
essentially of a U-shaped horizontal heat exchanger in which the heavy water coolant trans-
ferred heat to the light water of the steam system. Because the latter operated at a lower
pressure, some steam was generated around the tubes. Risers and downcomers circulated the
steam and water mixture to a steam drum and returned the water to the heat exchanger. The
long circular horizontal steam drum was similar to that of a conventional fossil fuel fired boiler
and had internal cyclones for effective steam separation. The overall configuration required
inlet and outlet headers at each end of the reactor to accommodate bi-directional coolant flow.
The former were supplied by three 50% capacity pumps, and the latter delivered coolant to a
single steam generator.
The NPD reactor was followed very closely by the Douglas Point reactor, the latter being essen-
tially an enlarged version capable of operating like a commercial power plant and producing
electric power to the grid system on a commercial scale. The site chosen was on Lake Huron,
where there was an adequate supply of cooling water to sustain large scale power production.
The most significant change was an upgrade in power from 20 MW electrical to 200 MW
electrical. This naturally required a larger and more robust calandria, and therefore the struc-
tural material was changed from aluminum alloy to stainless steel and the calandria tubes from
aluminum alloy to zirconium alloy. Because stainless steel is a stronger neutron absorber than
aluminum, the calandria diameter was further enlarged to accommodate an internal heavy
water reflector instead of an external light water reflector. The axial shields were moved
inwards so that the fuel channel end fittings would be outside the shield and therefore more
easily accessible.
The increased size of the Douglas Point reactor required fuel channels with a length of 5 m. This
meant more fuel bundles per channel. The one-eighth length fuel bundle was based on a
cosine flux distribution, but with flux flattening, such short lengths were not required, and oneGenealogy of CANDU Reactors 9

length fuel bundles would be used, the fuelling machines were therefore redesigned to handle
two bundles in each slot. This enabled the magazine to be smaller in diameter, but able to
accommodate 39 in (991 mm) of fuel with each fuel movement. Other changes in fuelling-
machine design provided positive control from both ends of the fuel channel during refuelling
and enabled refuelling in the same direction as coolant flow. The advantage of this was that
fresh fuel, which would give a higher local power output, would be in contact with cooler water
when only part of the fuel channel had been refuelled.
The larger output required increased steam generating capabilities. Furthermore, the longer
reactor put the inlet and outlet of each channel further apart. Therefore, it was decided to put
steam generators and circulating pumps at each end of the reactor. The same concept of
separate heat exchangers and steam drums was retained, but instead of one horizontal heat
exchanger, several vertical hairpin tube exchangers were used to feed a single steam drum in a
way similar to that in which steam is generated in the water walls of a fossil fuel fired boiler.
The multiple smaller heat exchangers could be replaced more easily than a single large one
should tube problems arise. With steam generators and circulating pumps at each end of the
reactor and with bi-directional flow, the “figure of eight” configuration for the heat transport
system was established for this and all future CANDU reactors. A further feature of Douglas
Point was the introduction of horizontal inlet and outlet headers above the highest fuel chan-
nels, but below the steam generators and circulating pumps. This would enable the system to
be partially drained for maintenance on the circulating pumps and steam generators while still
maintaining fuel cooling to remove decay heat. In normal operation, pressure was maintained
in the heat transport system by a feed-and-bleed system to minimize heavy water inventory.
Pickering was the first large scale multi-unit commercial CANDU plant. This was yet a further
scale-up from the 200 MW Douglas Point plant to a 4 x 500 MW plant. The 500 MW electrical
unit size was consistent with that of the coal fired units on the Ontario Hydro system. Signifi-
cant changes to the reactor included longer and wider fuel channels to accommodate the
increased fuel inventory. The fuel channels were 6 m in length instead of 5 m. Rather than
increasing the number of fuel channels excessively, it was decided to increase the diameter to a
nominal 4 in (102 mm) while retaining the fuel element or rod diameter. This resulted in fuel
bundles with 28 instead of 19 elements. This required a fuel channel 4.07 in (103 mm) in
diameter to maintain the standard minimum element spacing, which was maintained by pads
brazed to the element cladding. This then became the standard for all future CANDU reactors.
The end shields were redesigned, and the annular space between the pressure tube and calan-
dria tube filled with inert gas to minimize the risk of corrosion.
A further change was the adoption of a double “figure of eight” coolant loop with two hydrauli-
cally independent loops. This had the advantage of limiting the consequences of a loss of
coolant accident due to a pressure tube or feeder tube break because the fuel channels in half
the reactor would remain flooded without the need for emergency coolant injection. The
moderator dump system for emergency shutdown was retained, but due to the time needed to
drain the large calandria, it was supplemented with gravity operated shutoff rods. The latter
system was able to handle most reactor trips, and therefore a dump arrest system was added to
prevent dumping, enabling a faster reactor restart for such non-accident related trips.
The larger reactor introduced the possibility of flux oscillation, in which the peak flux wanders
from one region of the reactor to another, induced by xenon transients. To overcome this, the10 The Essential CANDU

appropriate amount of light water could act as a stronger neutron absorber than the surround-
ing heavy water moderator and thus achieve local flux control. This regional neutron flux
control system became a standard feature of all subsequent CANDU reactors.
An innovative change was the introduction of vertical steam generators which incorporated the
vertical U-tube heat exchange surface and steam separation cyclones into a single vessel with
provision for water recirculation and feedwater preheating. This design became the standard
for CANDU reactors and many pressurized light water reactors, or PWRs.
For a multi-unit station, the concept of a containment surrounding each reactor was maintained
and extended by linking the separate containments to a common vacuum building. In the event
of a major reactor accident and release of steam inside any containment, the vacuum building
would act to suck out and condense the steam, thus establishing a negative pressure in the
containment to prevent egress of radioactive material.
Bruce was the next large multi-unit nuclear generating station to be built. This involved a
change in the heat transport system. In previous designs, the outlet conditions of the fuel
channels varied due to the different power ratings of the channels across the reactor core. To
create more uniform conditions at the channel outlets, the central core region required a
greater degree of subcooling at the inlet. This was accomplished by having separate preheaters
outside some steam generators rather than integral preheaters and passing coolant for the
central region only through these preheaters. This complicated the flow system, but obtained
better matching of coolant outlet conditions. Another change was made to the steam genera-
tors, where the large U-tube heat exchanger as used in Pickering was retained, but without the
integral upper steam separating section. Instead, a single long horizontal steam drum was
attached to the top of all steam generators at each end of the reactor. The larger water-steam
interface reduced level control problems, but introduced thermal stress problems. This design
was used on Bruce A, while Bruce B reverted to the separate integral design as used at
Pickering.
Studies had indicated that a moderator dump system was too slow for a large reactor, and
therefore this was eliminated in favour of faster acting gravity shutoff rods. Because dumped
moderator would not be available for channel cooling in the event of loss of coolant, a new
system was developed for the next generation of reactors, but applied at Bruce. This was the
injection of high pressure water into the heat transport system headers from gas pressurized
storage tanks. For Bruce, the initial supply pressure was 800 lbf/in2(5.52 MPa), but this was
reduced to 600 lbf/in2(4.14 MPa) in subsequent reactors.
A further safety issue arose with regard to the shutdown system. Bearing in mind that the
CANDU design is a neatly balanced configuration of fuel and moderator, any disruption of this
configuration will render the reactor subcritical and inoperable. In the event of failure of the
shutdown system to operate in an overpower situation, the reactor would disassemble and shut
itself down. Further consideration of the core disassembly philosophy led to addition of a
second shutdown system which would remove the need to consider core disassembly for
licensing purposes. Because the shutoff rods operated in a vertical plane, a new system operat-
ing entirely independently on a horizontal plane was developed. Solid rods were considered,
but might suffer mechanical interference, so liquid rods were favoured. However, their effect
would be too localized, so liquid dispersion in the moderator was the ultimate choice. ByGenealogy of CANDU Reactors 11

nozzles in the reactor core, a very quick shutdown could be ensured. This system was driven by
helium in pressurized storage tanks and became standard on all CANDU reactors. Because
removal of the gadolinium nitrate from the moderator was a lengthy process, this became the
secondary shutdown system, while the shutoff rods remained the primary shutdown system
which operates first in adverse transient conditions requiring a reactor trip.
The next generation of CANDU units included Point Lepreau and Gentilly-II as well as a number
of overseas plants. A design for single unit stations was needed for these to be attractive to
small utilities. The major change was the requirement for a single large containment for the
reactor and heat transport system, including the steam generators, which would condense
released steam and contain radioactive products in the event of a large break and loss of
coolant accident. Other changes followed a natural evolution in reactor design. The fuel
bundles were modified from 28 to 37 element bundles by using smaller diameter elements.
The increased heat transfer surface thus created enabled a power increase from 500 MW to 600
MW electrical, while reducing the number of fuel channels from 390 to 380. This reactor
therefore became known as the CANDU 600. Furthermore, from 12 steam generators and 16
coolant pumps at Pickering, the design had evolved to 4 steam generators and 4 coolant pumps.
Experience in steam generator design had enabled larger components to be built. Comprehen-
sive testing had shown that some boiling could be permitted within the fuel channels, thus
increasing substantially the heat removal capability of the coolant. Darlington followed the
design of the CANDU 600, but with a degree of scaling up. The heat transport system main-
tained the same arrangement of two loops in a figure-of-eight configuration, with each loop
having a steam generator and a circulating pump at each end. For increased output, the reactor
was designed for 480 fuel channels instead of 380. For future reactors of this size, a change in
the figure-of-eight arrangement has been proposed. Instead of the two loops being in separate
halves of the reactor, they would be interleaved alternately between adjacent channels
throughout the reactor. The advantage of this would be to avoid a flux tilt and power pulse in
the event of a loss of coolant accident in one loop while still maintaining the advantages of the
two loop concept.
4.2 CANDU Reactors in Service
Table 2 lists the CANDU reactors in service in Canada with their commercial service start dates.
Of these, Point Lepreau and Gentilly 2 are both CANDU 600 or CANDU 6 reactors, which was the
basic reference design for reactors sold abroad. Table 3 lists CANDU 6 reactors in operation in
foreign countries. In this text, Point Lepreau has been selected as the reference plant because it
is typical of CANDU reactors on a worldwide basis.12 The Essential CANDU

4.3 Direct Steam Generation
Some reactors, such as the boiling water reactor or BWR, generate steam within the reactor
core. Due to the cost of heavy water and the formation of tritium, heavy water cannot be used
in the steam cycle because some leakage from this cycle is inevitable. Therefore, light water
must be used as the coolant. The CANDU with its separate moderator and coolant circuits
(unlike the light water PWR and BWR reactors in which the moderator and coolant are the same
and in a single loop) can be adapted for direct steam generation by using heavy water as mod-
erator in the calandria and light water as coolant in the fuel channels. Some boiling already
occurs in CANDU fuel channels, and this can be increased with vertical channels, where the
natural buoyancy effect enhances the forced circulation generated by the circulating pumps.
Steam is separated in horizontal steam drums similar to those in the early CANDU reactors.
Hence, we have the heavy water-light water reactor, or HWLWR.
The most successful of these was the 100 MWe Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor, or
SGHWR, built in the United Kingdom. This reactor operated as a commercial prototype and
produced reliable power to the national grid system from 1968 to 1990, when it reached the
end of its design life. It had some novel design aspects, including direct injection of emergency
coolant into the centres of the fuel bundles in the event of a loss of coolant accident, and
served as a testing ground for various types of fuel. Because light water, which absorbs more
neutrons than heavy water, was used as coolant, slightly enriched uranium in the form of
uranium dioxide was required. The steam became slightly radioactive due to formation of
nitrogen-16 in the reactor, and therefore certain precautions had to be taken by operational and
maintenance staff when working around the steam turbine and feedwater system. Gentilly-1, a
similar Canadian design, designated the CANDU Boiling Water Reactor or CANDU-BWR and also
known as the CANDU Boiling Light Water Reactor or CANDU BLW, was modelled on the SGHWR,
but fuelled with natural uranium. Built for an output of 250 MWe, first power was produced in
1971, and full power was achieved in 1972. However, it did not operate successfully. The
reactor had a strong positive power coefficient of reactivity when additional voidage due to
steam formation in the coolant channels occurred. Although this could be corrected by ab-
sorber rods in the core, the reactor remained difficult to control, and its operation was sporadic14 The Essential CANDU

decommissioned in 1984.
5The Current CANDU Reactor Design
5.1 Plant Arrangement
The general arrangement of the plant is shown in Figure 1. The active part of the reactor is
cylindrical in shape and set horizontally. The moderator is contained in the calandria, which is
about 6.0 m long and about 7.6 m in diameter for the CANDU 6. Because of the low internal
pressure in the calandria, the thickness of its shell and its tubes needs to be sufficient only to be
structurally sound and to support the weight of the moderator. Only the pressure tubes located
within the calandria tubes are pressurized. These pressure tubes, which contain the fuel and
through which the coolant flows, are arranged horizontally in an axial direction. The coolant is
fed to and from the pressure tubes by feeder tubes, which in turn are connected to headers
situated above the reactor. The headers in turn are connected to steam generators in which
heat from the coolant is used to generate steam. Circulating pumps, usually known as heat
transport pumps, drive the coolant around the primary circuit. A pressurizer maintains pressure
in the primary system to suppress large scale boiling and maintain operating temperatures.
Figure 1 Diagrammatic cross section of a typical CANDU (PHWR)
The moderator absorbs some energy from the neutrons as they are slowed down and also
receives some heat by conduction and radiation through the annulus gas between the pressure
tubes and calandria tubes as well as conduction through the tubes themselves. The low con-

moderator is therefore required to maintain a temperature of about 70°C, which means that a
circulating and cooling system is required. This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 2.
Figure 2 Moderator and coolant circuits
One characteristic when using heavy water as a moderator is that the neutron slowing down
distance is relatively long. This determines the spacing between the fuel channels because
neutrons need to be able to reach thermal equilibrium with the moderator before entering the
next fuel channel. Too short a distance results in under-moderation and too long a distance in
16 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Genealogy of CANDU Reactors – September 2016over-moderation. CANDU reactors are slightly over-moderated, but while this has some disad-
vantages, it does provide additional space between the fuel channels for various control de-
vices. Over-moderation enables additional neutrons to be absorbed in the moderator, and
when voidage occurs in the fuel channels, fewer neutrons are absorbed, thus increasing the
number of neutrons and giving a positive void coefficient of reactivity which must be counter-
acted in other ways. With a separate calandria, the moderator temperature can be kept rela-
tively low compared with the fuel and coolant. This is advantageous in reducing neutron energy
and promoting the fission process due to the increased fission cross section of uranium at lower
temperatures. In all CANDU reactors, the moderator in the calandria is maintained at atmos-
pheric pressure and a temperature of about 70°C.
5.2 Fuel Channel Conditions
In the CANDU reactor, coolant enters the fuel channels of the core in a subcooled state, but not
excessively subcooled. It leaves the most highly rated fuel channels with a vapour content of a
few percent, with boiling having occurred. The lower rated channels have little or no boiling. In
this way, nearly constant reactor coolant outlet temperatures can be maintained even though
some channels produce more heat than others. Furthermore, the outer channels with the
lowest rating can have their flow slightly restricted to enhance their coolant outlet tempera-
tures. Note in this context that for good thermodynamic efficiency, the cycle working fluid
should receive heat at the highest possible temperature. Hence, the reactor primary coolant
should be at the highest possible temperature so that it can supply heat to the secondary
working fluid at a suitably high temperature as well. Limited boiling in some fuel channels of a
CANDU reactor enables the average temperature of the coolant entering the steam generators
to be very near saturated conditions. An alternative view of the above review is that, by allow-
ing some boiling to occur in the fuel channels, the pressure of the primary circuit can be lower
while still maintaining desired steam generator temperatures. This has significant benefits in
the design and manufacture of a rather complex primary system with multiple pressure tubes
and feeder pipes.
Within individual fuel channels where boiling does occur, conditions are not uniform across the
fuel bundles. The circular arrangement of fuel elements in each bundle leads to irregularly
shaped and sized coolant channels. More boiling occurs in narrow channels than in wider ones.
The horizontal arrangement of the fuel bundles also creates non-uniform mixing between the
coolant channels because the lighter vapour tends to migrate upwards, resulting in some
vertical segregation of vapour and liquid across the channel. Although turbulence, particularly
at the abutting ends of fuel bundles, tends to equalize conditions, some fuel pins are subject to
more boiling than others. Boiling does enhance heat transfer, but excessive vapour is detrimen-
tal, and therefore fuel sheath temperatures do vary slightly across any particular fuel bundle.
5.3 Comparison of CANDU Reactors
The CANDU reactor has evolved progressively and has been marketed in several other coun-
tries. Three standardized versions, CANDU 300, CANDU 600, and CANDU 900, with different
capacities were developed. These are now known as CANDU 3, CANDU 6, and CANDU 9 respec-
tively. The original numbers indicate roughly the electrical output in megawatts, but later
developments have enabled much greater outputs to be achieved by the respective models.
Table 4 gives key technical parameters and shows the range in outputs available from theseGenealogy of CANDU Reactors 17
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Genealogy of CANDU Reactors – September 2016three models built up with similar basic components.
Although the CANDU 6, for example Point Lepreau, is representative of CANDU reactors in
general and most existing CANDU reactors are of this capacity, the CANDU 3 and CANDU 9, for
example Bruce and Darlington, were marketed as alternate capacities to suit smaller or larger
electrical utility systems respectively. The CANDU 9 is very similar to the CANDU 6, being simply
larger in diameter and with increased heat transport capacity. It therefore has the benefit of
economies of scale. The CANDU 3, however, was a novel development to minimize the adverse
effects of economies of scale, but no examples have been built. It is like a half CANDU 6 with a
single loop instead of a “figure of eight” loop with two steam generators at one end and two
heat transport pumps at the other, thus maintaining essentially the same size components as
the CANDU 6. Coolant flow is in one direction only, and only one refuelling machine is used,
which is located at the coolant outlet end so that coolant flow aids the discharge of fuel bun-
dles. A comparison of these three basic designs is given in Table 4. The technical parameters
given in Table 4 and those given in Section 6 were extracted from the Atomic Energy of Canada
publication “Technical Summary CANDU Nuclear Generating Station” which gives the parame-
ters for the 600 MW and 950 MW units (subsequently the CANDU 6 and CANDU 9). The com-
plete tabulated parameters are given in Appendix C to this chapter. Since publication these
parameters have been revised as new developments have allowed the design to evolve particu-
larly with regard to channel power. The parameters given for CANDU 9 (950 MW unit) are
therefore not representative of the latest plants for example Darlington which has a lesser
number of fuel channels each of which have a higher power rating. However Appendix C is
useful for comparison of the two unit sizes and serves well for educational purposes as the data
is based on the same design philosophy. A later AECL publication in 1997 “CANDU Technical
Summary” gives some technical parameters for the CANDU 6 but not for the CANDU 9.
As the CANDU design evolved with the proposed Bruce B and the later Darlington nuclear plants
these were nominally in the 800 MW range resulting in the CANDU 8 design. The AECL publica-
tion in 1989 “CANDU 8 Technical Outline” lists the net output of Bruce B as 825 MW and of
Darlington as 881 MW. Subsequently the terminology was rationalized as in Appendix B
“CANDU: The Evolution”. This shows the development of the CANDU up to the four-unit CANDU
600 MW class (Pickering) and the subsequent division into the single-unit CANDU 6 or 700 MW
class (Point Lepreau onwards) and the four-unit CANDU 900 MW class (Bruce A & B and Darling-
ton) with the further development of the single-unit CANDU 9 also 900 MW class.
5.4 Power Density
Power density is a measure of how much power is generated per unit volume of core. Gener-
ally, the higher the power density, the more compact is the reactor and the lower the capital
cost. In all reactors, therefore, there is an incentive firstly to maintain a high neutron flux (to
achieve a high heat release rate) right across the reactor core and secondly to maintain a high
heat flux (to achieve a high heat removal rate) everywhere in the reactor.
All CANDU reactors contain roughly the same amount of in-core fuel per channel, but the major
differences are in the fuel bundles themselves and in the number of channels. The total design
power output of a CANDU reactor can be fixed by selecting an appropriate number of fuel
channels for the reactor. In a CANDU 3 reactor there are 232 fuel channels, in the CANDU 6
reactor the number of channels is increased to 380, while in the CANDU 9 reactor there are 600
fuel channels.18 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Genealogy of CANDU Reactors – September 2016A new development is the Advanced CANDU Reactor, known as the ACR, which uses slightly
enriched uranium as fuel and light water as coolant. This has the benefit of significantly reduc-
ing the heavy water inventory. In the proposed ACR, the power density is increased by a smaller
calandria diameter, but with an increased number of elements in the fuel bundle and a smaller
channel pitch, resulting in a more compact reactor.

Point Lepreau has been chosen as the reference for this text because it is a typical CANDU 6
reactor. Technical parameters for other CANDU reactors are given here for comparison to show
the main differences, but other chapters will generally refer to Point Lepreau characteristics.

6.2 Reactor Core Arrangement
The reactor core is cylindrical, but is set horizontally, as shown in Figure 4, with horizontal fuel
channels. The heavy water moderator is contained in a cylindrical calandria with multiple tubes
set in a square array and in an axial direction so that the moderator surrounds all the tubes.
Pressure tubes containing the fuel bundles pass through the calandria tubes. Heavy water
coolant under a pressure of about 10 MPa flows through the pressure tubes to remove heat
from the fuel bundles. Because the coolant is heavy water, there is minimal absorption of
neutrons. Each pressure tube contains twelve fuel bundles, each of which has 37 fuel elements
arranged in a circular pattern, as shown in Figure 5. The fuel elements consist of zirconium-alloy
tubes filled with natural uranium dioxide pellets. A feature of the CANDU is that individual fuel
channels can be refuelled while the reactor is at full power by pushing new fuel elements in at
one end of the pressure tube and removing spent fuel elements at the other end, using special
refuelling machines which can be attached to the ends of any pressure tube.

Control of the reactor is achieved by varying the amount of light water in special liquid level
tubes in separate control zones in the calandria and by manipulation of control rods which are
inserted into special vertical channels within the calandria and pass at right angles between the
calandria tubes. Typical parameters for 600 MWe (electrical) and 950 MWe (electrical) CANDU

The reactor core includes monitoring and control devices to measure neutron flux and to
modify the flux profile if required to obtain the best power distribution. Safety devices to bring
about rapid shutdown, such as the shutoff rods and poison injection system, are also built into
the core. The general arrangement of these is shown in Figure 6, and their locations are shown
in the three views given in Figures 7, 8, and 9.Genealogy of CANDU Reactors 23

Genealogy of CANDU Reactors 27
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Genealogy of CANDU Reactors – September 2016loop. Flow in the pressure tubes is arranged to be in opposite directions in adjacent fuel chan-
nels. Thus, at each end of the reactor, there are sets of inlets and outlets to and from each fuel
channel, as shown in Figure 10. To carry the coolant to and from each of these inlets and
outlets, small diameter feeder tubes are used, as shown in Figure 11. These are linked to twin
common headers above each end of the reactor core. Coolant from the outlet headers at each
end passes to the steam generators, then through the coolant pumps and back to the inlet
headers at the same end of the reactor core. After a second pass through the fuel channels, the
coolant passes to steam generators and coolant pumps at the other end of the reactor core.
The complete coolant loop thus has a double figure-of-eight configuration. Typically, there are
two steam generators and two coolant pumps at each end of the reactor core, making a total of
four of each. Although each pair of steam generators and its associated coolant loop has a
separate figure-of-eight configuration, the headers are cross-connected so that the whole
system operates at the same pressure. Pressure is maintained by a single pressurizer connected
to one of the coolant loops. The pressurizer is a tall cylindrical vessel containing half water and
half steam and maintained at saturation conditions. By varying the temperature in the vessel
with heaters or water sprays, the pressure in the entire coolant system can be controlled.
Typical parameters for 600 MWe (electrical) and 950 MWe (electrical) CANDU coolant systems
are given in Table 6. Full technical details are given in Appendix C Single Unit Station Data.

The purpose of the steam generators
is to transfer heat from the primary
coolant system to the secondary
steam system and thus supply the
required heat to operate the steam
cycle. Like those of the PWR, the
steam generators are tube or surface
heat exchangers, with high pressure
coolant passing inside the tubes and
lower pressure steam being generated
on the outside of the tubes. The
steam pressure is typically 5 MPa. The
usual configuration is a vertical cylin-
der with inverted U-tubes in the lower
part and steam-water separators in
the upper part, as shown diagram-
matically in Figure 12. Steam gener-
ated within the tube bundle rises and
promotes natural circulation. At the
top of the vessel, the steam-water
mixture passes through cyclone type
primary separators where the steam is
separated from the circulating water.
The water returns down an annulus
between the tube bundle and the
steam generator shell. The separated
steam passes through secondary
separators or steam dryers to remove
moisture and so improve its quality
before passing out at the top of the
vessel. Incoming feedwater enters at the bottom of the steam generator. This cooler feedwater
is confined within baffles and made to flow in a criss-cross manner over that part of the tube
bundle near the primary coolant outlet. In this way, the feedwater temperature is raised to
saturation conditions before mixing with the circulating water in the steam generator. This
arrangement improves thermodynamic performance, but limits the range of temperature at
which feedwater can be introduced to the steam generator. A sudden drop in feedwater
temperature during normal operating conditions could cause thermal shock to the vessel and
tubes. Typical parameters for 600 MWe (electrical) and 950 MWe (electrical) CANDU reactor
steam generators are given in Table 7.Figure 12 Steam generator for CANDU system

6.5 Steam Turbines
Each CANDU unit has a single steam turbine and electrical generator on a single shaft. The
steam turbine consists of a high pressure turbine receiving saturated steam from the steam
generators and three low pressure turbines receiving steam, after moisture separation and
reheating, from the high pressure turbine. Saturated steam from the steam generator is used
for reheating, and the reheated steam becomes superheated at the lower pressure. This is
required to avoid too high a moisture content in the turbine exhaust. Three low pressure
turbines are required due to the large increase in steam specific volume as it expands to con-
denser conditions. Figure 13 shows the 600 MW steam turbine at Point Lepreau viewed from
the steam inlet end, with the steam inlet valves and high pressure turbine in the foreground and
the low pressure turbines further back. Figure 14 shows the same turbine from the electrical
output end, with the exciter and generator in the foreground and the low pressure turbines
behind them. Typical parameters for 600 MW (electrical) and 950 MW (electrical) steam
turbines are given in Table 8.Genealogy of CANDU Reactors 31

6.6 Technical Data
The technical data in this chapter were obtained from various sources, including references in
the bibliography and public relations brochures from Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, and
therefore are not necessarily applicable to a particular nuclear power plant. Some data may be
inconsistent or in conflict due to evolution of the design or to differences between design and
operational data. Furthermore, some missing data were deduced by simple calculation for
illustrative purposes and are indicated as an approximate value, meaning that what is presented
is typical rather than specific.
7Possible CANDU Reactor Development
7.1 CANDU Advantages
Refuelling can be done while the reactor is on power by pushing new fuel bundles in at one end
of a fuel channel while spent fuel bundles are removed at the other end. This allows the
CANDU reactors to achieve high capacity factors compared with those reactors which have to be
shut down periodically for refuelling. Figure 15 shows a typical annual analysis of capacity
factors for CANDU reactors and other light water reactors in the early years of their life before
major maintenance or refurbishment became necessary. This shows that in that year in the top
25 reactors worldwide, with regard to capacity factor performance, there are proportionately
twice as many CANDU reactors listed as in the general population of water cooled reactors.
One year within the first ten years of operation Point Lepreau was actually ranked first on this
list. This was due to only one short planned annual shutdown for routine maintenance of
systems not able to be accessed during normal operation during the initial years of operation.Genealogy of CANDU Reactors 33
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Genealogy of CANDU Reactors – September 2016Furthermore the relative simplicity of the fuel bundles and the use of natural uranium leads to
low fuel costs for CANDU reactors. With no heavy reactor pressure vessel and the possibility of
modular construction the erection time of a CANDU reactor can be shorter than that of some
other reactor systems. Having been developed to use natural uranium in conveniently small
fuel bundles, the CANDU reactor has the ability of utilizing low enriched fuel from other sources
such as light water reactors and also blended fuel from nuclear weapons. This makes it attrac-
tive as part of a fuel reprocessing and recycling scheme involving different nuclear plants and
facilities.
The refurbishment of CANDU reactors has been proven. Steam generators and reactor pressure
tubes can be replaced. This has the potential of effectively doubling the life of the plant ena-
bling it to operate efficiently for 50 to 60 years. The overall capital investment including the
cost of refurbishment can make the CANDU reactor an attractive investment for bulk base load
power production.

7.2 Future Prospects
Future prospects for the CANDU reactor are good. About one third of CANDU reactors in
operation are of the CANDU 6 type and all have performed well. The few larger reactors have
also provided good service. A CANDU reactor would be a good choice for any future nuclear
34 The Essential CANDU

cially the PWR where later designs are under construction.
Of particular note is the modular construction proposed for new reactors. The advantage that
this modular construction offers is a decreased construction time and hence lower costs. It also
allows specific parts of the reactor to be more easily replaced during the life of the plant.
New fuel bundles with 43 fuel elements have been developed and tested. The increased
surface area and smaller diameter elements resulting from this change allow for increased heat
transfer and hence more power per bundle. Such design developments are able to reduce the
capital and operating costs of the current CANDU system.
7.3 Safety Aspects
The primary way to avoid reactor accidents is through use of duplicate safety systems, core
cooling systems, and engineered safeguards built into the reactor design. The CANDU reactor
has evolved to be inherently safe, with consideration given to all conceivable accidents. Acci-
dents to early reactors, as mentioned earlier, have highlighted the need for very conservative
and safe design requirements.
In case of an adverse transient which could lead to a potential accident, there are two inde-
pendent shutdown systems. The SDS1 system consists of mechanical shutoff rods which drop
into the core by gravity when a trip signal is received. The SDS2 system consists of an array of
nozzles which inject gadolinium nitrate under gas pressure into the moderator on receipt of a
trip signal.
In the event of loss of coolant from the reactor heat transport system, an emergency core
cooling system injects cooling water into the headers to ensure a water supply to maintain fuel
cooling. This is backed up by alternative systems to maintain cooling for an extended period.
Use of multiple pressure tubes instead of a single large pressure vessel permits thinner walls
and simpler manufacture to the required pressure threshold. Any leaks can be detected by
monitoring moisture content and pressure in the gap between the pressure tube and the
calandria tube, which is done on a continuous basis. When detected, a faulty pressure tube can
be readily replaced.
The heavy water moderator and reflector in the calandria surrounding the pressure tubes are at
a relatively low temperature compared with that of the coolant flowing in the pressure tubes.
Because of this lower temperature, the moderator and reflector act as an energy sink in case of
certain reactor accidents. This heat sink is an important feature in the CANDU design because it
means that if the emergency core cooling system fails, some heat can be transferred from the
fuel to the moderator. The calandria itself is surrounded by light water in the reactor vault, thus
creating an additional short term heat sink for the moderator.
Most important are the engineered safeguards that protect the public from possible release of
fission products in the event of a component failure. As in most nuclear power plants, there are
four barriers that prevent the release of significant quantities of fission products to the envi-
ronment. These barriers are: the fuel itself, the fuel cladding, the primary heat transport system
boundary, and the containment building.
The first barrier is the uranium dioxide fuel, which is chemically inert even in high temperature
water and has a high melting point. Even under high temperature conditions, about 99% of allGenealogy of CANDU Reactors 35
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Genealogy of CANDU Reactors – September 2016radioactivity is trapped in the uranium dioxide matrix. This means that almost all solid fission
products are contained in the fuel under normal non-melting conditions.
The second barrier is the fuel cladding, which is a zirconium alloy sheath. This sheath is de-
signed to withstand the stress associated with fuel expansion and buildup of trapped fission
gases. Zirconium would be subject to damage should dryout and elevated temperatures occur
in the fuel channel. Provided the fuel bundles are kept flooded with coolant during accident
conditions, this barrier will remain intact.
The third barrier is the primary heat transport system boundary. This provides containment for
the coolant, which may contain fission products in the event of fuel cladding leakage. The
primary circuit is a closed loop and does not allow any fission products to go any further unless
it in turn has a leak.
The fourth and final barrier to fission product release is the prestressed low leakage concrete
containment building. The building is maintained under a slightly negative pressure and is lined
with a plastic coating which limits the leakage of fission products in the event of overpressure
due to an accident. In addition, air exchange filters in the ventilation system remove any fission
products in the circulating air which is discharged to the atmosphere.
7.4 The Advanced CANDU Reactor
A possible new development of the CANDU reactor is the Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR 1000),
with a nominal net electrical output of 1000 MWe. The general arrangement is very much the
same as the basic CANDU reactor, as shown in Figure 16, but some significant technical changes
have been included.
These reactors have been designed so that they can be built within a four-year period and have
an expected plant life of 60 years, with an overall lifetime capacity factor of over 90%. They use
light water instead of heavy water as coolant, thus simplifying several supporting auxiliary
systems. This necessitates use of low enrichment fuel to compensate for increased neutron
absorption in the coolant. The fuel bundles are of the CANFLEX 43 element design, as shown in
Figure 17, which provides increased power output per bundle and hence per channel. This
design has fuel elements of two different sizes. There are 8 central elements 13.5 mm in
diameter and 35 outer elements 11.5 mm in diameter. A quick comparison between the
CANDU 6 and Darlington Generating Station shows the general trend of the conventional
CANDU design towards larger capacities, while a comparison between Darlington and the ACR
1000 shows somewhat of a reversal of this trend with current technical changes. Table 9 shows
some key technical parameters which illustrate this trend.36 The Essential CANDU

The table clearly shows the evolution of the ACR 1000. The 43-element fuel bundle provides an
average channel power of 6.13 MW (12 bundles) as opposed to 5.43 MW (12 bundles) and 5.54
MW (13 bundles). This in turn enables fewer channels to be used for an equivalent output,
resulting in a smaller reactor for the same output. Furthermore, the channel pitch has been38 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Genealogy of CANDU Reactors – September 2016reduced by 16% resulting in an even smaller reactor. The overall result is that the ACR 1000
reactor is about the same size as the CANDU 6, as illustrated in Figure 18. The heavy water
inventory has been reduced accordingly. The light water coolant eliminates a pressurized heavy
water circuit altogether, thereby effecting a further and major saving in inventory and heavy
water support systems. The low enriched uranium increases the burnup by a factor of about 2.5
and consequently decreases the amount of spent fuel. An additional reserve water system
provides a passive safety feature, making this a Generation III+ design. Other than these
important changes, there are many small improvements in the general operating conditions of
the heat transport system and steam cycle, giving an improvement in overall efficiency from
35.3% to 36.6%, which ultimately saves on fuel consumption.

1.1 Fission Energy
All atoms consist of a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a cloud of electrons.
Generally, for elements of low atomic mass numbers, there are equal numbers of neutrons and
protons in the nucleus because this arrangement represents the most stable configuration. As
the atomic mass number increases, however, the increasing weak repulsive forces of similarly
charged protons in the nucleus are compensated for by an increasing number of neutrons which
contribute additional strong nuclear forces that bind adjacent protons and neutrons together.
Therefore, at high atomic mass numbers, there are approximately one and one-half times as
many neutrons as protons in the nucleus, as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1 Range of stable and unstable nuclides
4 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Introduction to Nuclear Reactors – June 2015Should an element of high atomic mass number split, during a fission process, into two ele-
ments of lower atomic mass number, not as many neutrons will be required to create a stable
configuration, and the surplus neutrons will be released.
The nucleons (neutrons and protons) in the nucleus are bound together by nuclear forces.
When a nucleus is assembled, the binding energy attracting the individual nucleons is released.
Conversely, energy is required to separate individual nucleons from one another or from the
nucleus. This is analogous to the attraction of magnets to one another, but with a different type
of force. This binding energy is a maximum per nucleon for elements near the middle of the
range of atomic mass numbers and is somewhat less for elements with high atomic mass
numbers, as shown in Figure 2. This means that, if a heavy element fissions or splits into two
mid-range elements, the nucleons are bound together with a greater amount of binding energy
per nucleon. The surplus energy is released as the nucleons come together more strongly. This
is analogous to masses with potential energy falling into deeper holes and releasing this energy.
Because of the well-known relationship between mass and energy, the release of binding
energy is accompanied by a very slight decrease in the total mass of the constituents.
Figure 2 Binding energy per nucleon
Elements with high atomic mass numbers are unstable and become more so as the atomic mass
number increases. If a neutron is added to the nucleus of a very heavy element, the additional
binding energy brought into the nucleus may excite it to the extent that it fissions. This occurs
in two isotopes of uranium and two isotopes of plutonium. Of these four fissile materials, only
uranium-235 is naturally occurring. Furthermore natural uranium contains only 0.7 percent of
U-235. Nevertheless, uranium-235 is the primary fuel of all commercial power producing
nuclear reactors.
Introduction to Nuclear Reactors 5
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Introduction to Nuclear Reactors – June 2015When a U-235 nucleus fissions, the release of binding energy amounts to about 200 MeV, or 32
x 10-12J. Although a very small amount, this translates into a heat production rate of 950 MW if
1 kg of U-235 is totally consumed per day. In a typical nuclear power plant operating on a
conventional steam cycle, this could be converted into an electrical power output of about 300
MW.
1.2 Nuclear Reactor Principles
Some heavy elements, such as uranium-235, can be induced to fission by adding a neutron to
their nuclei. When fission occurs, the resultant lighter elements do not require as many neu-
trons in their nuclei to maintain a stable configuration and, on average, between two and three
surplus neutrons are released. These neutrons can cause further fissioning of other U-235
nuclei and so establish a chain reaction. Such a reaction can be allowed to diverge, as in an
atomic bomb, or be controlled, as in a nuclear reactor. Under steady state conditions, just one
neutron on average from each fission should go on to produce another fission event.
When fission occurs, the release of energy drives the lighter elements or fission products and
the surplus neutrons away from one another at high velocity. Most of the energy is thus trans-
formed into kinetic energy carried by the fission products. As heavy strongly charged particles,
they do not travel any significant distance and dissipate their kinetic energy in the fuel by
interaction with other atoms, thus increasing the temperature of the fuel. The high energy fast
neutrons, being uncharged, readily pass through the fuel and other reactor materials.
Figure 3 Fission and absorption characteristics of uranium
There are varying probabilities that they will be absorbed by different nuclei. The probability of
absorption by another U-235 nucleus to cause fission increases if the neutron velocity is re-
duced, and therefore reducing neutron energies is advantageous. Figure 3 shows the variation
of the fission cross section, that is, the probability of a fission reaction, of U-235 versus neutron
energy as a dotted line. The probability increases by a factor of nearly 500 as the neutron
energy is reduced from the fissioning release energy to the natural energy of neutrons in the
local environment, a process known as thermalization. This can be achieved by allowing theU-235

16 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Introduction to Nuclear Reactors – June 2015neutrons to experience a series of non-absorbing collisions with light nuclei, which during an
elastic collision receive some of the energy from the neutrons. The resulting low energy slow
neutrons are then absorbed in U-235 nuclei to cause further fissions. Some elements that can
slow down or moderate neutrons effectively without significant absorption are hydrogen,
deuterium, helium, beryllium, and carbon. Hence, light water (H 2O), heavy water (D 2O), and
graphite (C) all make good moderators in nuclear reactors.
The solid lines in Figure 3 show the total probability of absorption (resulting in both fission and
capture) in U-235 and U-238. In the resonance region (where neutron and nucleus frequencies
coincide) are large spikes with very high probability of capture for U-238, so it is best to avoid
this region during the neutron slowing down process. This can be achieved to some degree by
ensuring that the moderation process is carried out away from the fuel. This leads to a reactor
consisting of a matrix of fuel elements within the moderator with a discrete distance between
fuel elements. Furthermore, to promote heat transfer from the fuel, the fuel elements them-
selves consist of bundles of small fuel rods. This is illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 4.
Most of the heat from fission is generated by dissipation of the kinetic energy of the fission
products. Because this occurs in the fuel near the point of fission, it follows that the fuel
becomes the main source of heat in the reactor. To maintain a thermodynamic cycle to produce
work, this heat must be removed continuously as it is produced. A suitable coolant is therefore
required to flow over the fuel elements and remove the heat. The coolant must not readily
absorb neutrons and must have suitable thermal properties. Coolants such as light water, heavy
water, helium, and carbon dioxide meet these requirements.
Finally, to ensure steady state operation, the number of neutrons allowed to go on to produce
fission must be the same as the number in preceding generations of neutrons. To achieve the
required balance, the reactor as a whole is designed to generate excess neutrons in each
generation and to have a system for absorbing the excess so as to maintain and control the
reactor at a steady load. This also enables the number of neutrons in successive generations to
be increased when more power is required or to be decreased when power must be reduced.
Such control is usually achieved by having movable neutron-absorbing control rods partially
inserted into the reactor. By fully inserting the control rods, the reactor can be shut down.
Therefore, a typical nuclear reactor consists of the following main components as shown in
Figure 4:
Fuel in which fission occurs and heat is generated
Moderator to reduce the energy of the neutrons
Coolant to remove the heat from the fuel elements
Control rods to maintain the proper neutron balance.Introduction to Nuclear Reactors 7

These components are usually arranged in a two-dimensional matrix so that neutrons generat-
ed by fission in one fuel rod pass through the moderator before entering the next fuel rod. The
spacing of the fuel rods depends upon the moderator properties and the distance required to
reduce the energy of the neutrons. The fuel rods are made small enough to promote heat
removal and are surrounded by coolant. Often the coolant serves as a moderator as well. The
control rods are made to penetrate between the fuel rods to capture excess neutrons effective-
ly. Naturally, some neutrons leak through the boundaries of the system, and many are absorbed
by the reactor materials or in the fuel without causing fission, meaning that the control rods do
not have to absorb a significantly large number of neutrons compared with the number causing
fission. The actual configuration of the matrix and the spacing of the fuel rods depend upon the
fuel and moderator characteristics.
2Reactor Types
2.1 Prototype Reactors
As nuclear reactors developed around the key elements of fuel, moderator, and coolant, many
different types were proposed and constructed as demonstration models in an endeavour to
prove their technical and commercial viability. Some designs had serious technical problems,
while others had uniquely advanced features. However, due to arbitrary political decisions, one
or two good designs did not go beyond the prototype stage, while others with insurmountable
technical difficulties were abandoned. Nevertheless, some prototypes did operate successfully
for many years, providing valuable technical and operational experience while producing power.
Ultimately, the field narrowed to certain proven designs which were adopted on a commercial
basis. Currently, there are six main types, which are listed below in order of numbers in service.
The first five have proven to be commercially viable, while the sixth can be considered to be still
in the prototype stage, but to hold promise for the future as a reactor which can breed new
fissile fuel:

2.2 Commercial Reactors
The reactors listed above will be described briefly in the following paragraphs for comparison,
starting with the simplest concept.
2.2.1 Boiling water reactor (BWR)
The boiling water reactor consists of a pressure vessel containing the fuel rods in vertical
elements, with each element surrounded by a channel. The channels are flooded with light
water which serves as the moderator and coolant. Pumps circulate water upwards through the
channels, and steam is generated within the channels. The exit steam quality is about 13%, and
the steam is separated from the water in cyclone separators above the reactor core. This
saturated steam is sent directly to the steam turbines.
Figure 5 Diagrammatic cross section of a typical BWR
This simple direct cycle has the disadvantage that steam from the reactor is passed through the
turbine and the condensate is returned through the feedwater heaters, making the whole
steam circuit slightly radioactive during operation. A simplified diagram of a boiling water
reactor is given in Figure 5.

The pressurized water reactor overcomes the problem of a slightly radioactive steam circuit by
having an intermediate heat exchanger to separate the reactor coolant circuit from the turbine
steam circuit. Steam is generated in this steam generator and is sent to the turbine as saturated
steam under conditions similar to those in the boiling water reactor. The reactor coolant circuit
is maintained at high pressure to prevent any boiling in the reactor and operates at a slightly
higher temperature than the BWR to promote heat transfer to the secondary steam circuit.
Because no boiling occurs in the reactor core, it is more compact and does not require channels.
The fuel rods of the individual elements form a continuous vertical matrix in the core. This is
flooded with an upward flow of circulating light water which serves as coolant and moderator.
A simplified diagram of a pressurized water reactor is given in Figure 6.
2.2.3 Pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) (CANDU)
The pressurized heavy water reactor is similar to the pressurized water reactor in that it has a
primary coolant circuit and secondary steam circuit with a steam generator producing saturated
steam. The reactor, however, is different in that it has individual pressure tubes passing hori-
zontally through the reactor core. Fuel rods in the form of bundles are contained within these
pressure tubes. The heavy water coolant flows through these tubes and is then circulated
through the steam generator. The pressure tubes are surrounded on the outside by heavy
water at low pressure and low temperature, which serves as the moderator. This is contained in
a large vessel or calandria at ambient pressure. The advantage of this system is that it does not
require a very heavy pressure vessel as in the BWR and PWR. The Canadian version is known as
the CANDU. Other variations such as the steam generating heavy water reactor (SGHWR) had
light water coolant and vertical channels and generated steam in the core. A simplified diagramFigure 6 Diagrammatic cross section of a typical PWR

2.2.4 Gas cooled reactor (GCR)
The gas cooled reactor, like the pressurized water reactor, has separate reactor coolant and
steam generating circuits with an intermediate steam generator. The coolant, however, is gas,
which enables higher coolant temperatures to be achieved. This enables superheated steam to
be generated and a high efficiency steam circuit similar to that of a fossil fuel fired plant to be
used. Due to the high temperatures and large core volume required with a gas coolant, graphite
is more suitable than water as a moderator. This is installed in the form of blocks with holes to
form channels into which the fuel elements are placed and through which the gas coolant flows.
The early reactors of this type were known as Magnox from the type of fuel used, and later ones
were called advanced gas cooled reactors (AGRs), which run at higher temperatures with a
different type of fuel. By changing the coolant from carbon dioxide to helium, even higher
temperatures could be achieved, hence the designation high temperature reactor (HTR). This
type gave the ultimate advantage of large gas cooled reactors, which have a cycle efficiency as
high as any fossil fuel fired plant.
Later developments in this field, such as the pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR), use a direct
cycle, with the helium coolant passing directly to a helium turbine with the promise of even
better cycle efficiency. A simplified diagram of an advanced gas cooled reactor is given in Figure
8.Figure 7 Diagrammatic cross section of a typical PHWR (CANDU)

2.2.5 Liquid graphite reactor (LGR)
The liquid graphite reactor has a graphite block core similar to that of a gas cooled reactor.
Pressure tubes similar to those of the pressurized heavy water reactor pass through vertical
holes in the graphite, which serves as the moderator. Fuel elements made up of clusters of rods
are located within these vertical tubes, and light water coolant flows upwards over the fuel and
within the tubes. Boiling occurs in the fuel as in the boiling water reactor. The resulting steam
is separated from the water in an external drum and the water recirculated. As with the boiling
water reactor, saturated steam is sent to the turbine. This type of reactor of Russian design is
known as the RBMK. A simplified diagram of a liquid graphite reactor is given in Figure 9.

12 The Essential CANDU

The liquid metal fast breeder reactor is different from the others in many ways. The coolant is a
liquid metal, usually sodium, which flows directly over the fuel rods of the vertical fuel elements
in an upward direction. The heat carried in this primary circuit is transferred to a secondary
sodium circuit in a heat exchanger. This secondary circuit then transfers the heat to the steam
circuit in a steam generator. Because sodium remains a liquid at high temperatures without
being pressurized, heavy pressure vessels are not required, and high temperature superheated
steam can be produced to provide good cycle efficiency. There is no moderator to reduce the
energy of the neutrons, hence the term “fast”, and surplus neutrons are used to convert non-
fissile material into fissile fuel, hence the term “breeder”. This type of reactor has not yet
reached the commercially viable stage, and therefore there is no typical design.
3World-Wide Commercial Power Reactors
3.1 Reactor Development
Following the Second World War, the development of nuclear reactors followed different paths
in different countries depending upon the facilities developed during the war and the perceived
military needs of certain countries following the war. The first nuclear reactors served to
generate plutonium-239, another fissile material formed when uranium-238, the major consti-
tuent of natural uranium, absorbs excess neutrons. Pu-239 could be easily separated from the
original uranium fuel and was needed for atomic bombs. U-235 is also used in nuclear wea-
pons, but is difficult to separate from U-238.
The United States had isotope separation facilities for uranium and therefore was able to pursue
the development of light water reactors requiring the use of uranium fuel slightly enriched in U-
235. The United Kingdom did not have such facilities and therefore was forced to develop
reactors using natural uranium. Canada had developed expertise in heavy water technology as
a result of the war effort and was therefore well positioned to develop heavy water moderated
reactors also using natural uranium.
When using natural uranium as a fuel, the low concentration of U-235 and the absorption of
neutrons in U-238 necessitate use of a moderator with an extremely low absorption cross
section to establish a continuous chain reaction. Only heavy water (deuterium and oxygen) and
graphite (carbon) have the required physical and neutron properties. This led Britain to develop
graphite moderated natural uranium metal fueled reactors with carbon dioxide as a coolant.
Later, when they had uranium enrichment facilities, they were able to switch to uranium dioxide
as the fuel. Canada, which had supplies of heavy water, was able to develop heavy water
moderated natural uranium dioxide fueled reactors. Heavy water is the only moderator that
can be used directly with natural uranium dioxide fuel to sustain the required fission chain
reaction. Although heavy water is an excellent moderator, especially with respect to neutron
absorption, it is very expensive to separate from ordinary water. If enriched uranium is availa-
ble, as was the case in the United States, there is wider scope in the choice of a moderator
because more neutron absorption can be tolerated. Therefore, light water (hydrogen and
oxygen) can be used as a moderator. An advantage of light water as a moderator is that it is
very effective per unit distance in slowing down neutrons, leading to a smaller moderator
volume and a more compact reactor than with the other moderators. However, light water has
the inherent disadvantage of absorbing a greater fraction of neutrons than graphite or heavyIntroduction to Nuclear Reactors 13

Of the three moderators mentioned above, graphite is the least effective in reducing neutron
energy and requires the largest volume. Graphite moderated reactors are therefore the largest,
leading to high capital costs. Considering capital cost, moderator costs, and enriched fuel
supply and cost, all three of these became economically viable in their respective countries, and
commercial reactors for power plants subsequently evolved.
Over time, enriched uranium became more easily available, and commercial reactors were sold
to other countries which did not have fuel enrichment resources, leading to a free choice of
reactors. It is of interest to review the world use of nuclear reactors for electric power produc-
tion.
3.2 Commercial Reactors in Service
Table 1 shows the number, type, and output of reactors operating and committed or under
construction in different countries. The first column under the two latter headings is for reac-
tors currently in service and the second column for those reactors to be added in the coming
years. This table is representative of current commercial technology because most prototype
and early commercial reactors have served their useful life and been decommissioned.14 The Essential CANDU

It is evident from Table 1 that certain types of reactors became dominant in certain countries,
particularly in those developing their own reactors, for example, PWRs and BWRs in the United
States, GCRs in the United Kingdom, PHWRs in Canada, and LGRs in Russia. However, in later
years, certain types of reactors have been favoured by countries without their own develop-
mental program, leading to the spread of some of these types to other countries. The PWR,
however, has become the most common type and is currently produced by various manufactur-16 The Essential CANDU

3.3 Recent Past and Near Future
Table 2 gives a summary of the situation at the beginning of 2012. It shows that PWRs make up
61% of operational reactors and 67% of total nuclear capacity, due mainly to their larger size
relative to PHWRs and GCRs.

A similar review done in 1998 indicated that during the intervening 14 years, the number of
reactors in service had only increased by two, but that total capacity had increased by 11%. This
was due primarily to the decommissioning of smaller older reactors which had reached the end
of their economic life. It does not reflect a lack of new plants coming on-line because the
number of PWRs increased by 17, even though 10 were taken out of service during this period.
Looking forward over 10 years to 2022, Table 3 shows the total number of reactors currently in
service and committed for commissioning or construction. Although the table does not consid-
er possible decommissioning of some reactors, it also does not take account of new orders
which will be completed before 2022. In this context, it should be noted that 80% of new
construction is due to be on-line by 2017, leaving time for new commitments which will likely
overcompensate for possible decommissionings.Introduction to Nuclear Reactors 17

4Power Production
4.1 Energy Transfer
Heat, energy, and work all have the same units (joules), but somewhat different meanings, and
power is the rate of doing work (watts). What is important is that not all heat can be converted
into work. Although the first law of thermodynamics states that all work can be dissipated as
heat, the second law states that not all heat can be converted into work. In a typical water
cooled nuclear plant (CANDU, PWR and BWR) approximately 30% of the heat released by the
fuel is ultimately converted into electrical energy. The rest must be discharged as low grade
(low temperature) heat.
During the fission process, heat is generated in the fuel. This heat is removed by the reactor
coolant flowing over the fuel rods and transported in the primary circuit to the steam generator,
where it flows inside the tubes and its heat is transferred to the secondary circuit through the
walls of the tubes in the steam generator. Water in the secondary circuit outside the tubes
absorbs this heat and is converted into steam under saturated conditions. This steam is passed
to the turbine where it expands to low pressure while being directed onto the turbine blades
and in so doing transfers its energy to the turbine rotor. The rotor drives the electrical genera-
tor which produces electric power. The exhaust steam is condensed by cooling water passing
through the condenser tubes and in so doing discharges the bulk of the heat which cannot be
converted into work. The condensate is returned to the steam generator after being preheated
in the feedwater heating system. A simple flow diagram for a nuclear plant is shown in Figure
10. Note that in the BWR and RBMK, steam is generated directly in the reactor, so there is noIntroduction to Nuclear Reactors 19

4.2 Power Output
Consider a very simple system with a nuclear reactor, steam generator, and turbine generator
supplying electric power to an isolated electrical grid, as shown in Figure 11. This power must
be generated at the moment it is required by the consumers connected to the grid. Power
production must follow demand exactly, and any mismatch will cause the grid frequency to fall
or rise as demand increases or decreases. A basic control system works as follows to maintain
appropriate power output from the plant. In the event of an increase in demand the mismatch
will cause the grid frequency to fall. Because the turbine generator is synchronized to the grid,
its speed will drop accordingly. This will be sensed by the turbine governor which will open the
governor valves to admit more steam to increase the power output of the turbine generator.
The additional flow of steam to the turbine will cause a reduction in steam pressure in the
steam generator. This in turn will be sensed by the reactor regulating system which will with-
draw control rods from the reactor core until the increased fission rate generates sufficient
additional heat to restore the steam generator pressure. In the event of a decrease in demand
the reverse occurs. This is known as the reactor following or turbine leading mode of operation
(or normal mode in some plants because it is a natural way of maintaining stable conditions).
Such a system, however, cannot maintain a specified frequency (60 Hz in North America) exactly
without large unstable oscillations, and therefore a certain speed droop is incorporated into the
turbine governor. This enables a progressive increase in governor valve opening (steam flow) as
the turbine speed (grid frequency) falls. A typical droop setting is 4%, which means that, if the
turbine was initially at zero load and full speed, its speed would have to drop to 96% before the
governor valve would be fully open. Such a speed is not acceptable for the turbine due to
possible blade vibration, nor to the grid due to loss in speed of connected motors. Therefore,
the governor is adjusted to bring the speed back to 100% at full load. In the event of a turbine
trip or load reduction to zero under these conditions, the reverse would occur, and the turbine
speed would rise to 104% of full speed.

©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Introduction to Nuclear Reactors – June 2015Figure 11 Lagging and leading plant operation
In the mode of operation just described, the nuclear reactor output follows the electrical grid
demand, and therefore its power level oscillates continuously. This can have adverse effects
depending upon the type and design of the reactor. Excessive oscillations impose temperature
transients on the fuel, which can cause premature failures of the fuel cladding. Large oscilla-
tions near full power can cause power limits to be exceeded, thus tripping the reactor and
losing power production as well as imposing restart transients on it and the turbine. Due to
high capital cost and low fuel cost it is desirable to run nuclear reactors at full power most of the
time. An alternative mode of operation is therefore often used at nuclear plants where the
reactor power output is fixed. This is known as reactor leading or turbine lagging operation. To
maintain stable operation, the reactor power is controlled at a given value by measuring the
neutron flux and adjusting the control rods accordingly. Pressure in the steam generator must
be maintained at the proper value to ensure stable conditions in the reactor coolant circuit.
This is done by opening or closing the turbine governor valves to control steam flow from the
Introduction to Nuclear Reactors 21
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Introduction to Nuclear Reactors – June 2015generators. The turbine then delivers power according to the steam flow and the generator
sends this power into the grid system regardless of the grid frequency. The grid frequency must
then be controlled by other turbine generators which feed into the grid system and operate in
the turbine leading mode.
By referring to the figure showing the two modes of operation, it can be seen that steam
generator pressure is a key control parameter in both modes. This highlights the importance of
the steam generator, where a balance of heat input and heat output must be maintained to
maintain pressure. Furthermore, the difference in temperature between the primary coolant
and the secondary working fluid determines the rate of heat transfer. Hence the reactor coo-
lant temperature is determined by saturation temperature and thus by steam generator pres-
sure.
4.3 Operating Constraints
During operation, parts of the reactor, steam system, and turbine are subject to high tempera-
tures. If these parts have thick walls or have a substantial solid mass they will likely suffer
thermal stress during the heating and cooling that arises during startup and shutdown and also
during load transients. If a thick component is heated on one side, that side will tend to ex-
pand. If the side is constrained by the still cold base material so that it cannot expand an
internal stress will be set up. The reverse happens during cooling. Therefore, large rigid com-
ponents which are subject to transient and uneven heating and cooling will suffer low cycle
fatigue damage and may ultimately fail. This effect can be minimized by slow heating and
cooling to reduce temperature differences in single components such as reactor pressure
vessels, steam generators, steam pipes, turbine casings and turbine rotors. This means that all
these components must be preheated slowly before startup and the unit must be loaded slowly.
Similarly, load changes on the unit should be carried out slowly. This requirement imposes
operating restrictions on reactors and turbines. Generally, the larger the unit, the longer the
time to start it up and load it. This makes large units less flexible in operation than smaller
units.
In the reactor, temperature transients in the fuel cause structural changes within the fuel and
stress on the cladding and therefore must be minimized to avoid premature fuel failures. In the
turbine, uneven heating and cooling of the rotor can cause bending, which in turn causes
excessive vibration and in the extreme case contact with the casing and therefore must be
monitored very carefully.
A nuclear reactor is also subject to xenon transients which may inhibit operation for a certain
period. When the load on a reactor is suddenly reduced, xenon, a fission product that absorbs
neutrons very strongly, builds up in the fuel and may force a reactor shutdown. The xenon
eventually decays after about 40 hours, and the reactor can be restarted. During this time,
there is a loss in electrical power production, and the larger the unit, the more serious is this
loss in revenue generating output.
4.4 Fuel Burnup
As the fuel in the reactor is used up, the concentration of uranium-235 decreases. This reduces
the number of fissions occurring with a given number of neutrons. Furthermore, some of the
fission products produced absorb neutrons, thus reducing the number of neutrons available to
produce fission. These changes can be accommodated by withdrawing the control rods from22 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Introduction to Nuclear Reactors – June 2015the reactor and allowing more neutrons to be available in the fuel. After a long period of
operation, however, such changes can no longer be accommodated, and the fuel may have
become depleted in U-235 to the point where a continuous chain reaction can no longer be
sustained. At this point, the reactor has to be refuelled with fresh fuel.
With reactors that are partially refuelled once a year, the control rods do not provide an ade-
quate range of control, and therefore a soluble neutron absorber is added in small quantities to
the moderator. Its concentration is gradually reduced over time to compensate for fuel burnup.
Some reactors are designed for continuous on-load refuelling. This is advantageous because the
effects of fuel burnup and fission product production are negligible with regard to overall
reactor conditions.
5Safety and Licensing
5.1 Radiation Hazards
Many types of radiation, both natural and human generated, are encountered in everyday life.
Even the human body contains radioactive materials. This radiation can be divided into two
categories. The first is electromagnetic radiation, which is assumed to travel in waves of dis-
crete frequencies, for example, X-rays, γ-rays, and UV rays.  The second is particulate radiation 
consisting of high-energy particles moving at high velocity, such as -particles, -particles,
neutrons, etc. Charged particles such as -particles and -particles are easily stopped by
ionization of surrounding material, but γ-rays and neutrons can be very penetrating due to their 
low interaction with most materials.
Radiation causes damage to biological structures such as cells. However, cells are in a continual
state of dying and being replaced, so such damage is naturally repaired provided that it is not
excessive. Of concern though is possible damage to DNA structures and subsequent genetic
effects. For this reason exposure to radiation is controlled much more rigidly than exposure to
toxic materials and dangerous chemicals.  Although γ-rays and neutrons can penetrate the 
human body, -radiation and -radiation are generally damaging only if materials that emit
these particles are ingested or come into contact with skin.
In the core of a nuclear reactor, the fission process produces neutrons and highly reactive fission
products which emit -particles and -particles as well as γ-radiation as they decay to stable 
isotopes.  Neutrons and γ-rays are emitted from the core, but are attenuated to low and safe 
levels by adequate shielding around the reactor. The fission products are held within the fuel
and therefore do not pose a hazard unless released to the environment through leakage from
the fuel or rupture of the fuel.
During operation of a nuclear plant, small amounts of leakage inevitably occur because some
fission products are gaseous and attenuation cannot eliminate all radiation. Therefore, the
entire operational area within and surrounding the plant as well as the local environment is
continuously monitored to ensure that radiation is kept well within safe limits and usually kept
much lower.
In the event of a serious accident, for example, fuel overheating and rupture of reactor compo-
nents, the design of all reactors makes provision for barriers to contain these fission products
and prevent their release to the environment. Such barriers may not be perfect, and some
radioactive products may be released. If people in the surrounding area ingest such products,Introduction to Nuclear Reactors 23
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Introduction to Nuclear Reactors – June 2015they will be subject to -radiation or -radiation emitted by these products, along with some γ-
radiation resulting from the decay process. The design of the plant has, as a key objective, the
provision of safety devices and containment barriers to ensure that radiation exposure to the
public is kept well below acceptable limits in the event of an accident.
5.2 Risk Assessment
Humankind is subject to many risks, both natural and human generated. These risks have been
analyzed, and if the severity of an accident is compared with the probability of its occurrence, it
is generally found that the probability of an accident occurring is much higher if the number of
deaths per accident is low (motor vehicle accidents) than if the number of deaths is high (air-
craft accidents). Because the consequences of a serious nuclear accident (for example, the
Chernobyl accident) can be very severe, the probability of its occurrence must be kept very low.
This puts great pressure on the nuclear industry to minimize the risk of serious accidents to
levels far below those of other industries. The result is that the nuclear industry is the most
regulated of all industries. Highly sophisticated design and accident analysis techniques and
requirements are in place to ensure public safety.
5.3 Licensing Principles
All nuclear plants are subject to a rigorous licensing process by an independent regulatory
authority to ensure safety of operating personnel and the general public and to ensure that
there are no detrimental effects to the surrounding environment. All aspects of the plant are
checked and assessed with regard to the effects of possible failures of key components. Initially
this assessment was based on the maximum credible accident due to a single failure. In the
event of the worst possible accident, the likely damage to the plant was assessed and the
containment barriers reviewed to determine the likely amount of radioactive fission product
release to the environment. This release was to be kept below specified values. This concept
did not take account of the possible (though very unlikely) failure of a component deemed not
to fail, nor did it take account of multiple minor failures which could have a cumulative or
cascading effect, causing an otherwise unpredicted failure of a key component.
The modern approach, based on the probability of failure of a key component and the conse-
quences of such a failure, overcomes the shortcomings mentioned above. A component
deemed not to fail can be given a very low but still finite probability of failure. Moreover,
multiple components which are all associated with one type of accident can each be given a
certain probability of failure, and hence the probability of simultaneous failure can be assessed.
Ultimately the entire plant can be assessed to determine the probability of an accident leading
to a certain release of radioactive fission products. Hence, the safety of the surrounding envi-
ronment and population can be ensured to a very high degree, that is, a very low probability of
damage to the environment or excessive radiation exposure to the population.
The transition to a probabilistic approach as opposed to the deterministic method was initially
difficult due to a lack of statistical data and because certain failures could have different root
causes. However, as the industry has matured, more statistical data have become available
from test results and operating experience. Nevertheless, the process remains complex.
Another consideration is the relative importance of component failure and human error. A
quick analysis done many years ago indicated that roughly half of various incidents and acci-
dents in operating nuclear plants around the world were caused by human error and roughly24 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Introduction to Nuclear Reactors – June 2015half by component failure. Many component failures could be ascribed to human error during
component design or manufacture. Rigorous quality control, quality assurance, and quality
management procedures can minimize manufacturing and construction defects. Proper train-
ing, assessment, and licensing of plant operators can minimize human error during operation.
This all contributes to a lower risk of accident and increased safety in nuclear plants.
A further development in the nuclear industry is the concept of passive safety. This means that
in the event of a failure leading to accident conditions, the reactor will naturally revert to a safe
shutdown condition and maintain that condition with minimal operator intervention, even in
the event of the loss of key services. Some newer designs, for example, can maintain reactor
cooling after shutdown by natural coolant circulation and natural heat convection to the envi-
ronment.

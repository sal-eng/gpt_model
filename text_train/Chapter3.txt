Energy production in an operating nuclear reactor is mainly the result of fission reactions
initiated by neutrons. Following these reactions, radiation is produced in the form of alpha
particles, electrons ( ߚ-particles), photons, and neutrons, as well as a large number of unstable
nuclei (including actinides and fission products) that may decay, thereby producing additional
radiation and energy. The neutrons generated directly in the fission reaction as well as those
resulting from fission product decay are a key factor in maintaining and controlling the chain
reaction as discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. Radiation also has an impact on the properties of
the various materials in the core as well as on living cells. It is therefore important to under-
stand how radiation interacts with matter if one needs, for example, to evaluate the radio-
toxicity of burned fuel (Chapter 19) or to determine the kind of barrier that must be put in
place to protect the public, the environment, or the personnel in a nuclear power plant
(Chapter 12). Moreover, the energy produced by these decays contributes to heating the fuel,
whether it is still in the reactor or in the spent fuel pools. The aim of this chapter is to provide
the reader with an overview of the nuclear processes that take place in and around a reactor.
1.1 Overview
Several very important processes take place simultaneously in a nuclear reactor, including
neutron slowdown as a result of collisions with nuclei, nuclear fission, and decay of radioactive
nuclei with radiation emissions that subsequently lose energy or are absorbed.
To understand how all these physical processes take place, it is important to possess a general
knowledge of the physics of the nucleus, including its composition and the fundamental forces
that affect its behaviour. Although one rarely uses a description of the nucleus in terms of
elementary particles and their interaction in power-reactor applications, such a description
provides a practical background for a study of nuclear structure. In fact, the nucleus is such a
complex object that it can be described only through simplified models that provide useful
information. For example, the liquid drop model (Section 2.4) gives an empirical description of
how one can extract energy from a nucleus by breaking it into smaller components (fission or
decay) or by combining nuclei (fusion). These models are also used to predict the stability of a
nucleus under various decay processes, the energy associated with its excited states, and the
associated gamma-ray spectrum. In Section 2, an overview of the structure of the nucleus is
provided, starting from a fundamental description and progressing to more practical models.
We will also introduce some language specific to nuclear physics that will be useful throughout
this book.
The majority of the fission reactions taking place in a reactor are initiated following the
absorption of a neutron by a heavy nucleus. Radioprotection also involves the interaction
between radiation, in the form of alpha particles, electrons, photons, and neutrons, and
matter. Two important points must then be addressed before describing the physics of
neutrons in a nuclear reactor: the source of this radiation and its behaviour over time, and the
interaction of the emitted particles with matter. Therefore, Section 3 is divided into three
parts: it starts with a description of radioactivity and the decay of nuclei, continues with a
description of the interaction of ionizing radiation with matter (everything but neutrons),
which is a very important topic for radiation protection studies, and ends with a brief discus-
sion of the interaction of neutrons with matter.4 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Nuclear Physics – June 2015The last section of this chapter is dedicated to the nuclear chain reaction. It starts by giving an
extensive description of the fission reaction and discusses the need to slow down neutrons.
This is followed by a description of the neutron transport equation that can be used to charac-
terize the behaviour of neutrons inside a reactor.
1.2 Learning Outcomes
The goal of this chapter is for the reader to:
Understand the fundamental forces in nature and the structure of the nucleus;
Learn how to compute the mass of a nucleus based on the liquid drop model and to
evaluate the energy released by the fission and fusion processes;
Understand how to evaluate the activity and radio-toxicity of spent fuel;
Become familiar with nuclear cross-section databases for neutrons and ionization radiation
and the computation of reaction rates between particles and matter;
Recognize the need to slow down neutrons in thermal reactors and to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of a moderator.
2Structure of the Nucleus
2.1 Fundamental Interactions and Elementary Particles
Four forces, or interactions, are currently sufficient to understand and explain nature from
particle physics to astrophysics, including chemical and biological processes. These forces are
classified relative to their intensity at the nuclear level (distances of the order of 1 fm) as
follows:
The strong force: responsible for the cohesion of the proton as well as the nucleus. This
force is always attractive.
The electromagnetic force: governs the physics of the atom and the associated chemical
and biological processes. This force can be both attractive and repulsive.
The weak force: responsible for the existence of the neutron as well as many other radio-
active nuclei. This force is always attractive.
The gravitational force: governs the large-scale structure of the universe. This force
ensures the stability of the solar system as well as the fact that people can keep their feet
on the ground. This force is always attractive.
From the point of view of physics, these forces arise from the specific intrinsic properties of
the particles on which they act. For example, the electromagnetic force arises between two
particles that have electric charges, while the gravitational force appears between two parti-
cles with masses (or more generally, between two particles with energy). For the strong force,
the so-called “colour” of the particle plays a role equivalent to that of electric charge in
electromagnetic interactions, while the weak force is the result of the interaction of two
particles having a “weak” charge. Table 1 provides a brief description of the general proper-
ties of the four fundamental forces, where the ߙ’s are dimensionless coupling constants
related to the intensity of the interaction and the spatial dependence of the force is expressed
in powers of ݎ, the distance between the two interacting particles [Halzen1984]. For example,
the electromagnetic force between two particles of charge ݁ݖandܼ݁is given by:Nuclear Processes and Neutron Physics 5

permittivity of vacuum, ℏ=1.0546×10ିଷସJ × s is the reduced Planck constant, and
ܿ= 2.9979 × 10଼m/s is the speed of light. For the gravitational force, the coupling constant
is expressed in terms of proton masses. One can immediately see that the range of the
gravitational and electromagnetic forces is substantially larger than that of the weak force due
to theirଵ
௥మdependence. Accordingly, the weak force is important only when two particles
with weak charges are in close contact. On the other hand, the strong (colour) force remains
significant irrespective of the distance between particles with colour charge. This observation
led to the concept of colour confinement, meaning that it is impossible to isolate a particle
having a net colour charge different from zero [Halzen1984].

Gravitational Mass ߙீ≈10ିଷଽݎିଶ
In the standard model of particle physics [Halzen1984, Le Sech2010], these forces are repre-
sented by 12 virtual particles of spin 1 called “gauge bosons”:
the massless photon that carries the electromagnetic interaction;
eight massless gluons that carry the strong (colour) force;
three massive bosons (W±and Z଴) that mediate the weak interaction.
These bosons are exchanged between the 12 “physical fermions” (spin 1/2 particles) that
make up all the matter in the universe:
six light fermions or leptons that have a weak charge. Three of these have no electric
charge (the neutrinos), while three are charged (electron, muon, and tau);
six heavy fermions or quarks that have colour, weak, and electric charges. These fermions
cannot exist freely in nature because of colour confinement and must be combined in trip-
lets of quarks or quark-antiquark pairs to form respectively baryons (protons, neutrons)
and mesons (pion, kaon) that have no net colour charge.6 The Essential CANDU

of one electron [Le Sech2010].
2.2 Protons, Neutrons, and the Nuclear Force
The two lightest baryons that can be created out of a quark triplet are the positively charged
proton, which is composed of two ݑquarks and one ݀quark, and the neutral neutron, made
up of two݀quarks and one ݑquark. These are present in the nucleus of all the elements
present naturally in the universe. The main properties of the proton and the neutron are
provided in Table 3 [Basdevant2005]. One can immediately see that the masses of the proton
and neutron are very large compared with those of the ݑand݀quarks. In fact, most of their
mass is a result of the strong colour force (gluon interaction). One can also observe that
protons are stable, while neutrons are unstable and decay relatively rapidly into protons
through the weak interaction. A second observation is that the magnetic moment, which is
created by the movement of charged particles, is negative for the neutron. This confirms, at
least partially, the theory that neutrons are made of quarks because even though the neutron
is neutral, the distribution of charge inside it is not uniform.

Although the proton and neutron have a neutral colour, they interact through the nuclear
force, which is a residual of the strong colour force. However, instead of exchanging gluons
directly, as do the quarks inside the proton or neutron, they interact by exchanging of virtual
pion. As a result, the nuclear force is much weaker than the strong force in the same way thatNuclear Processes and Neutron Physics 7
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Nuclear Physics – June 2015the Van der Waals force between neutral atoms is weaker than the electromagnetic force.
Moreover, in contrast to the strong colour force, the magnitude of the nuclear force decreases
rapidly with distance, the nuclear interaction being given approximately by the Yukawa poten-
tial:
VYukawa(r)= -aNce-mpcr

r, (2)
where݉గis the mass of the pion (140 MeV/c2) andߙே≈14.5is a constant that controls the
strength of the nuclear interactions between baryons (protons or neutrons). The minus sign
here indicates that the resulting force ( ܨ⃗=−∇ሬሬܸ⃗)is always attractive. This potential is identi-
cal for proton-proton, proton-neutron, and neutron-neutron interactions.
The strength of this force at short distances is so intense that it can compensate for the
repulsive electromagnetic force between protons, leading to the formation of bonded nuclei
as well as inhibiting neutron decay. For example, the helium nucleus, which is composed of
two protons and two neutrons, is stable. Similarly, the stable deuteron is composed of one
proton and one neutron. The absence in nature of a nucleus composed of two protons is not a
result of the fact that the electromagnetic force is greater than the strong force, but rather
due to the exact structure of the nuclear force. In addition to having a spatial behaviour
provided by the Yukawa potential, this potential is also spin-dependent and repulsive between
particles with anti-parallel spins (a nucleus with two protons having parallel spins is not
permitted because of Pauli’s exclusion principle). This also explains why stable nuclei contain-
ing only neutrons are not seen in nature.
2.3 Nuclear Chart
As indicated in the previous section, not all combinations of neutrons and protons can lead to
bonded states. Figure 1 provides a list of all bonded nuclei [Brookhaven2013, KAERI2013].
The points in red represent stable nuclei, while those in green indicate radioactive nuclei. The
straight black line indicates nuclei having the same number of neutrons and protons. Note
that this chart is quite different from the periodic table, where the classification of the ele-
ments is based on the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus. Because the number of
electrons surrounding the nucleus is identical to ܼ, the number of protons inside the nucleus,
each element corresponds to a combination of the nuclei that are found on a horizontal line of
the nuclear chart. The nomenclature used to classify these nuclei is the following:
The number of protons in the nucleus is used to identify the element. For example, all
nuclei withܼ= 8 are known as oxygen (atomic symbol O), independently of the number
of neutrons present in the nucleus.
For a given element, the specific isotope is identified by ܣ=ܼ+ܰ, whereܣis known as
the mass number and ܰis the number of neutrons in the nucleus. For example, oxygen-
17, denoted byଵ଻O, corresponds to an oxygen atom where the nucleus has eight protons
and nine neutrons. Instead of the notationேା௓X, with X the element associated with ܼ,
the notation௓ேା௓X is also found in the literature.
Two other terms are less frequently used: isobars, corresponding to nuclei having the same
mass numbers, but different values for ܼandܰ; and isotones, corresponding to nuclei
having the same number of neutrons, but a different number of protons.8

where the mass of the proton has been replaced by that of the hydrogen atom, which includes
the electron mass as well as its binding energy. The approximation sign comes from the fact
that the binding energy of each of the ܼelectrons around a heavy nucleus is different from
that of a single electron attached to a proton in the hydrogen atom.
Finally, the natural composition of a given element will include stable as well as some radioac-
tive isotopes. Assuming that the relative atomic abundance of isotope ݅of atomic mass ܯ௜in

[KAERI2013, WebElements2013].
2.4 Nuclear Mass and the Liquid Drop Model
As discussed in Section 2.3, the mass of the nucleus is smaller than its classical mass (the mass
of its constituents) because the strong force linking the nucleons reduces the global energy of
the nuclear system, the binding energy being related to the missing mass Δ݉Xaccording to
2Δ .Xm c AB (10)
This missing mass is very difficult to compute based on theoretical models because the form of
the nuclear potential is known only approximately and because quantum models involving
more than two particles in interaction cannot be solved exactly. For evaluation of the missing
mass, one generally relies on a semi-empirical model known as the liquid drop model. The
main assumption used in this model is that the nuclear force is identical for protons and
neutrons.
The liquid drop model first assumes that each of the ܣnucleons in the nucleus sees the same
nuclear potential [Basdevant2005]. Moreover, this potential is independent of the number of
nucleons in the nucleus. This second assumption can be justified by the fact that the range of
the nuclear force is small, and therefore each nucleon feels the effect of only the limitedNuclear Processes and Neutron Physics 11

theܣnucleons is given by:
2Δ ,V Vm c a A (11)
where the constant ܽ௏≈15.753 MeV has been determined experimentally. This contribution
is known as the volume effect because the volume of a nucleus can be assumed to be propor-
tional to the number of nucleons it contains. This term would be sufficient if the nucleus had
an infinite size. However, this is not the case, and the protons and neutrons that are located
near the boundary of the nucleus will interact with a smaller number of nucleons. If the
surface of the nucleus is given by 4ܴߨଶ∝ܣଶ/ଷ, one can assume that the ܣଶ/ଷnucleons near
the outer surface of the nucleus see a reduced uniform potential. This leads to a negative
surface contribution to the mass defect of the form:
2 2/3Δ ,S Sm c a A (12)
whereܽௌ≈17.804 MeV.
Until now, only the nuclear force has been taken into account. However, the protons present
inside the nucleus repel each other through the Coulomb force, thereby decreasing the
binding energy. Because the potential associated with this force is long-range ( ܸ(ܴ)∝1/ܴ∝
1/ܣଵ/ଷ), each of the ܼprotons will interact with the remaining ܼ−1protons, leading to a
contribution of the form:

where only the dominant term in ܼhas been preserved, and ܽ஼≈0.7103 MeV.
It can be observed in the nuclear chart that stable nuclei with a low mass number generally
contain an equal number of protons and neutrons. As the number of excess neutrons or
protons in a nucleus increases, it becomes more and more unstable until no bonded state can
be produced. This means that nuclear binding should decrease as a function of |ܰ−ܼ|=

few stable nuclei with an odd number of neutrons and protons (odd-odd nuclei) can be found
in nature, while the number of isotopes with an even number of protons and neutrons (even-
even nuclei) dominates. This means that the binding energy should be large for even-even
and small for odd-odd nuclei. Assuming that the contribution to the missing mass presented
previously remains valid only for odd-even or even-odd nuclei ( ܣodd), an additional empirical
correction of the form

This equation, which is also illustrated in Figure 1 (the nuclear stability curve), closely follows
the nuclear stability profile.
The main weakness of the liquid drop model is its lack of predictive power. For example, it
neither explains the presence of “magic numbers”, nor the gamma-ray absorption spectrum,
nor the decay characteristics of different nuclei. These explanations can be obtained only by
looking at the interactions between protons and neutrons using quantum theory, as explained
in the next section.
2.5 Excitation Energy and Advanced Nuclear Models
All chemists and physicists are familiar with atomic “magic numbers”, even though the explicit
term is rarely used. For example, the number of electrons in noble gases could be considered
“magic” because these gases are odourless, colourless, and have very low chemical reactivity.
For such atoms, all the states associated with principal quantum energy levels 1to݊are
occupied by electrons (closed or filled shells). In addition, the absorption (emission) spectrum
of light by different atoms is the result of electrons being excited (de-excited) from one elec-
tronic shell to another. One can therefore expect nuclear magic numbers to have a similar
nature, namely, that only specific energy levels are permitted for the protons and neutrons
when they are bonded inside a nucleus (which would explain also the photon emission and
absorption spectra). These energy levels are not uniformly distributed, but occur in bands
called shells . The fact that all the quantum states in a shell (a neutron or proton shell) are
occupied by a nucleon increases the stability of the nucleus compared to nuclides with par-
tially filled shells.
To obtain the energy levels permitted for protons and neutrons inside the nucleus, one needs
to solve the quantum-mechanics Schrödinger equation for ܣstrongly coupled nucleons
[Griffiths2005]. However, when trying to solve this equation, two problems arise:
the Schrödinger equation has no analytic solution for problems where three or more
particles are coupled;
the interaction potential between nucleons is not known exactly.
As a result, this many-body problem is generally simplified using the following assumptions
that are inherent to the shell model [Basdevant2005]:
each nucleon in the nucleus is assumed to move independently without being affected by
the displacement of other nucleons;Nuclear Processes and Neutron Physics

2.6 Nuclear Fission and Fusion
Let us look back at Figure 2 , where the average binding energy per nucleon is provided as a
function of mass number. As mentioned previously, this curve indicates that the total binding
of one heavy nuclide containing ܣ> 180 nucleons, which is given by
,AE AB A (25)
is larger than that of two identical nuclides containing ܣ/2protons and neutrons:
/2 . 22A AAE AB E (26)
In physical terms, this means that two lighter nuclides generally represent a lower energy state
than a heavier nucleus. Accordingly, a spontaneous reaction where the heavy nuclide, ܪ,
breaks down into two smaller components ( ܮଵandܮଶ)is permitted from an energy-
conservation point of view, with the energy released by the reaction given by ܧ௅భ+ܧ௅మ−ܧு.
This spontaneous reaction, called fission, has been observed experimentally for long-lived
actinides such asଶଷଶTh,ଶଷହU,andଶଷ଼U,even though this is not their preferential decay
mode (seven in 109decays ofଶଷହUfollow this path). For example, the spontaneous fission
reaction
92235UÞ201n+50133Sn+42100Mo, (27)
which releases 116 MeV, has been observed.
A second observation is that, even if a spontaneous fission reaction is very improbable, the
fission process can be initiated externally by an absorption collision between a projectile and a
heavy nuclide. For example, the neutron-induced reaction,
1 235 1 133 100
0     92 0    50    42    3      ,n U n Sn Mo (28)
is possible even with very low-energy neutrons and produces the same amount of energy as
the spontaneous fission reaction above. This reaction is facilitated by the fact that the main16 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Nuclear Physics – June 2015interaction between the neutron and a nucleus is the attractive nuclear force. The fact that
several neutrons are generally produced following such reactions finally leads to the concept
of a controlled chain reaction, if sufficient neutrons are produced following a fission reaction
to initiate another fission reaction. The conditions required to achieve and maintain such a
chain reaction are discussed in Section 4.
Figure 2 also indicates that the nucleons inside very light nuclides are loosely bonded com-
pared to intermediate-mass nuclei. Combining two such nuclides could therefore result in a
nucleus that is more strongly bonded, again releasing energy. This process is called nuclear
fusion. Examples of such exothermal fusion reactions are

1 1 0 2        ,H H n He (29)
2 3 1 4
1 2 1 2        ,H He H He (30)
which release respectively 17.6 and 18.3 MeV in the form of kinetic energy for the final fusion
products. Producing such reactions is much more difficult than neutron-induced fission
because the two initial nuclides have positive charges and must overcome the Coulomb force
to come into close contact. This can be achieved by providing sufficient kinetic energy (plasma
temperature) for a sufficient long time (confinement) to ensure that the energy released by
fusion is greater than the energy required to reach these conditions (the break-even point).
The two main technologies that are currently able to attain the conditions necessary for
controlled nuclear fusion are based respectively on confinement by magnetic fields (Tokamak)
and inertial confinement (fusion by laser).
3Nuclear Reactions
From the nuclear chart ( Figure 1 ), it is clear that only 266 nuclides are stable. This means that
most of the bonded nuclei that can be created will decay. This raises two questions:
How do they decay?
How are they created?
Another observation is that if one succeeds in creating a nucleus (stable or not), it may not
necessarily be in its fundamental (ground) energy state (see Section 2.5). These are the main
questions to answer in the first part of this section. We start by discussing the decay process
before continuing with a description of nuclear reactions. The second topic involves the
interaction of particles with matter, with most of these particles being produced during the
decay process.
3.1 Radioactivity and Nuclear Decay
Nuclear decay, the emission of radiation from an unstable nucleus or radioisotope, is a sto-
chastic process controlled by the laws of statistics and physics. Therefore, it cannot take place
unless several fundamental quantities are conserved [Basdevant2005, Smith2000]:
total energy (including mass, which is a form of energy according to special relativity);
linear momentum;
angular momentum;
electric charge;
leptonic charge; and
baryonic charge.Nuclear Processes and Neutron Physics 17
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Nuclear Physics – June 2015The latter two are required because of the intrinsic properties of quarks and leptons. For
common nuclear reactions, these last two conservation relations can be translated to:
conservation of electrons and neutrinos where the electron and the neutrino have a
leptonic charge of +1 and the positron (anti-electron) and anti-neutrino have a leptonic
charge of -1; and
conservation of the total number of protons plus neutrons (mass number).
A decay process transforms, through emission of particles, a parent nucleus into a more stable
daughter nucleus (a nucleus with a lower mass where the nucleons are more strongly bonded
or equivalently have a lower mass). In fact, if one considers a nucleus at rest that decays
according to the following reaction:

that is, when the energy balance is favourable (the last two equations are for mass number
and charge conservation). For a nucleus in an excited state, the daughter nucleus will often be
the same as the parent nucleus, but at a different energy level (ground or lower-lying excited
state), the secondary particle being a photon (a ߛ-ray because the photon is produced follow-
ing a nuclear reaction).

reactions must often take place before a stable isotope is reached.

can be identified by the changes in N and Z between the initial and final nuclides.
3.2 Nuclear Reactions
As we saw in the previous section, several types of particles are produced through decay of
radioactive nuclides. These particles have kinetic energy, and as they travel through matter,
they interact with orbital electrons and nuclei. A nuclear reaction takes place if these particles
produce after a collision one or more nuclei that are different from the original nucleus (an
excited state of the original nucleus or a new nucleus). Otherwise, the collision gives rise to a
simple scattering reaction where kinetic energy is conserved.
For the case where charged particles are traveling through a material, scattering collisions with
the orbital electrons or the nucleus are mainly observed (also called potential scattering).
More rarely, the charged particles are captured by the nucleus to form a compound nucleus (a
very short-lived, semi-bonded nucleus) that can decay through various channels.
Similarly, the electric and magnetic fields associated with the photons interact mostly with the
nucleus or the orbital electrons. They can also initiate nuclear reactions after being absorbed
in the nucleus. Finally, neutrons rarely interact with electrons because they are neutral
particles and the electrons are not affected by the nuclear force (electromagnetic interaction
with the quarks inside the nucleon, magnetic interactions with unpaired electrons, and weak
interactions are still present). However, they can be scattered (nuclear potential scattering) or
absorbed (nuclear reaction) by the nucleus. Again, this absorption can lead to the formation
of a very unstable compound nucleus that will decay rapidly.
The main nuclear reactions of photons, electrons, neutrons, and charged heavy particles with
nuclei are often the inverses of the decay reactions presented earlier:

These reactions must obey the same conservation laws as those described earlier for the
decay reaction. For most reactions (except elastic scattering), the final nucleus will be in a
highly excited state and will decay rapidly by ߛ-ray emission (prompt photons).
The probability that any given reaction will take place between a nucleus and a particle is
represented by the microscopic cross section ߪ. Much like the decay constant, the cross
sections have a quantum mechanical interpretation and can be expressed in terms of the wave

initial nucleus is at rest), and ߩ(݂)is again the density of states in the phase space Ξfor final
particles. The cross section, which is then the integration over the final phase space of the
differential cross section, has units of surface. The most common unit used for the micro-
scopic cross section is the barn (b), with 1 b = 10ିଶସcmଶ= 10ିଶ଼mଶ.
These cross sections are very difficult to evaluate explicitly because of the complexity of the
wave functions (the wave function for a nucleus is the product of the wave functions of all the
nucleons in the nucleus bonded by the nuclear potential) and the interaction potential. These
are generally evaluated experimentally, and the results are stored in evaluated nuclear data
files. A software package such as Janis can be used to retrieve and analyze these cross sec-
tions [OECD-NEA2013]. For computational reactor physics, the NJOY program is generally
used to process the cross-section databases for neutron-induced reactions [MacFarlane2010].
3.3 Interactions of Charged Particles with Matter
As mentioned earlier, charged particles traveling through matter interact mainly with atomic
electrons because they are much more numerous than nuclei ( ܼelectrons for a nucleus with
atomic number ܼ) and also because the wave functions associated with these electrons have a
very large spatial extension (the size of an atom) compared to that associated with the nu-
cleus.
Heavy particles, such as protons, ߙ-particles, and ions, are scattered by the Coulomb potential
produced by the electron, with the cross section given by the Mott scattering formula
[Leroy2009, Bjorken1964]. As a result, a heavy particle loses a very small quantity of energy
and momentum to secondary electrons and travels mainly in a straight line as it slows down.
The secondary electrons, on the other hand, can gain enough energy to be knocked loose from
the atom, leaving it in an ionized state.
For electrons and positrons traveling through matter, the problem is somewhat more complex.
The cross section for electron-electron collisions is given by the Möeller scattering formula,
while Bhabha scattering is used for positron-electron collisions [Leroy2009, Bjorken1964].
Positrons lose, on average, half their energy in collision with atomic electrons, and their
trajectory is somewhat erratic. Positron-electron annihilation reactions can also take place,
producing two ߛ-rays. Finally, the electrons and positrons that are accelerated in the strong
electromagnetic field of a heavy nucleus lose some of their energy by ߛ-ray emission due to
synchrotron radiation (also known as Bremsstrahlung) [Leroy2009, Bjorken1964].
One can approximate the energy loss of a particle of charge ݖand mass݉inside a material of
densityߩ, atomic number ܼ,and atomic mass ܯusing the continuous slowing-down approxi-
mation (CSDA), where one assumes that the particle is interacting constantly with an electron
gas of density ݊given by
 .A n ZM (65)
The energy loss per unit distance traveled by the particle inside the material ( −ܧ݀/ݔ݀,)
known as the stopping power, is then given by the Bethe-Block formula [Smith2000,
Leroy2009]:

important when they reach a low energy.

are more useful. This type of information for electrons, protons, and ߙ-particles can be found

ESTAR, for electrons;

For heavy particles, this site also provides information on nuclear stopping power. Also note

interest in nuclear reactor-related studies are:
Photoelectric effect;

Photonuclear reactions.

probability per unit distance travelled by a photon of energy ܧthat an interaction of type ݔ

Let us now describe in detail the five reactions contributing to ߪ(ܧ)and discuss their respec-
tive dependences on the energy of the incident photon.
3.4.1 Photoelectric effect
This effect is illustrated in Figure 7 . A photon with an energy ܧℎ=ߥthat is greater than the

atom, producing an Auger electron cascade.
3.4.2 Rayleigh scattering
This elastic scattering reaction takes place when a photon, after being absorbed by a bound
atomic electron, is re-emitted with the same energy, but in a different direction, by the elec-
tron, returning the atom to its original state [Leroy2009, Jauch1976]. The cross section for this
reaction is very difficult to evaluate because it depends strongly on the wave function of the
bonded electrons surrounding the nucleus. It is generally written as an integral of the form
 2

whereܨ(ܧ,ߠ,ܼ)is the atomic form factor that represents the effect of the ܼelectrons sur-
rounding the nucleus on the scattering of a photon at an angle ߠwith respect to the initial
photon direction. Several theoretical expressions for ܨ(ܧ,ߠ,ܼ)are available in the literature
for different values of ܼand various energy ranges. For example, when the photon energy is
greater than 100 keV, the main contributors to Rayleigh scattering are the electrons in the K-
shell, and the relativistic Bethe-Levinger form factor is used [Hubbell1975]:

gZ( )=1+aeZ( )2. (83)
Because Rayleigh scattering is never the dominant photon reaction (see Figure 6 ) for the
photon energy range considered in nuclear reactors, its contribution to the total cross section
is often neglected.
3.4.3 Compton scattering
The Compton effect is the incoherent inelastic scattering of a photon by an electron that is
weakly bonded to a nucleus (see Figure 8 ). Here, a photon with momentum ݇ሬ⃗(ห݇ሬ⃗ห=ℎߥ/ܿ=
ܧ/ܿ) is scattered at an angle ߠwith respect to its original direction, with the final momentum
of the photon being ݇ሬ⃗′. The electron is then ejected with a kinetic energy ܶ௘,obtained by
conservation of momentum and energy:

where the binding energy of the electron is assumed to be small compared to the photon

3.5 Interactions of Neutrons with Matter
Neutron interaction with matter is the result of the nuclear force, although weak and electro-
magnetic interactions, the latter being the result of anomalous magnetic moment, are also
possible. As a result, only neutron-nucleus interactions are generally considered, including
elastic potential scattering with cross section σĞůĂƐƟĐ;
inelastic scattering with cross section σŝŶĞůĂƐƟĐ;
neutron absorption with cross section σĂďƐŽƌƉƟŽŶ;and
spallation reactions, σƐƉĂůůĂƟŽŶ.
In the first three reactions, the neutron interacts with the nucleus as a whole. In spallation
reactions, the neutrons interact directly with the nucleons in the nucleus. The latter reaction
can take place only when the energy of the incident neutron ܧ௡,௜is sufficiently high (threshold
reactions with ܧ௡,௜>0.1 MeV), and therefore σspallation is either neglected, because it is too
small, or simply included in the absorption cross section. The probability that the neutron
interacts with a nucleus is then given by the total cross section, σ, where

Elastic potential scattering is an interaction in which kinetic energy is conserved and the
neutron does not penetrate the nucleus. As a result, the neutron is slowed down, transferring
part of its energy to the nucleus. For a collision between a neutron with an initial kinetic
energyܧ௡,௜and a nucleus of mass ܯXat rest, the final neutron kinetic energy ܧ௡,௙(momentum

The neutron-nucleus interaction cross sections are very complex and in most cases are evalu-
ated using a combination of theory and experiment. They are generally tabulated in evaluated
nuclear data files that can be read by nuclear calculation software (NJOY , for example)
[MacFarlane2010]. They can also be extracted on-line from nuclear databases or off-line using
the Janis software [KAERI2013, Livermore2013, OECD-NEA2013].

4Fission and Nuclear Chain Reaction
The concept of controlled energy production in a nuclear reactor is based on three fundamen-
tal ideas that were discussed in Sections 2.6, 3.1, and 3.2, namely:
energy is released if a heavy nucleus is fragmented into lighter nuclei, the fragmentation
process being called nuclear fission;
the spontaneous nuclear fission process, which has a very low yield for several heavy
nuclei, generates neutrons in addition to the light nuclei as end products;
the nuclear fission process can be initiated by neutrons and photons.
Accordingly, a neutron of kinetic energy ܶ௡travelling through a medium containing heavy
nuclei at rest could initiate a fission reaction:

rapidly lose their energy in matter (see Section 3.3), thereby producing heat that is removed
by the coolant and transformed to electricity.
Not all the neutrons produced after this reaction initiate a fission reaction. A number of them
are absorbed by material without producing a fission reaction. Others simply leave the system
(with or without collisions). Provided that on average a single neutron per fission reaction can
initiate a new fission, a controlled exothermal chain reaction can be established. Establishing
such a chain reaction looks relatively simple; however, this is far from the case, as shown in
the following subsections.
4.1 Fission Cross Sections
The probability of fission is given by the value of the fission cross sections associated with a
nucleus and depends on the energy of the neutron that initiates the reaction. All isotopes
with atomic number ܼ> 90 are fissionable (have a non-zero probability of undergoing fission
following the capture of a neutron). Table 5 compares the average energy, ܷ, required to
initiate a fission reaction in different nuclei with the energy, ܳ, available in the compound
nucleus after a neutron with a vanishing kinetic energy has been captured. For nuclei contain-
ing an even number of protons and an odd number of neutrons, ܳ>ܷ. Such isotopes are
called fissile isotopes because the internal energy of the compound nucleus resulting from
neutron capture is sufficient to surmount the potential barrier for fission even when the
incident neutrons are very slow ( ܶ௡≈0). For isotopes with ܳ<ܷ, the fission barrier can be
overcome only using neutrons with relatively high kinetic energy. Fission for these nuclei is a
threshold reaction.
Table 5 Comparison of the energy, U, required for a fission reaction in a compound nucleus
with the energy, Q, available after a neutron collision with different isotopes.

Uଽଶଶଷ଼4.9 5.9
Puଽସଶଷଽ6.4 5.5
As shown in Figure 13 , the energy dependence of the fission cross sections for Uଽଶଶଷହand Uଽଶଶଷ଼
reflects the behaviour described above. The probability that a neutron of energy ܧ௡< 1.0
MeV will collide with Uଽଶଶଷ଼and result in a fission reaction is very low. For Uଽଶଶଷହ, there is no
lower limit on the neutron energy, and the fission probability increases as the energy of the
neutron decreases. The neutron capture cross section (neutron absorption followed by
photon emission) for Uଽଶଶଷ଼dominates at low energy, while for Uଽଶଶଷହ,it remains relatively small
compared to the fission cross section (approximately 10%) over the full energy range. As a
result, most neutron absorption in Uଽଶଶଷହwill lead to fission followed by production of new
neutrons (neutrons are regenerated). For Uଽଶଶଷ଼, a collision with a neutron having energy below36 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Nuclear Physics – June 2015the fission threshold will lead to a net neutron loss. As a result, the natural uranium fuels used
in CANDU reactors ( 0.72 atomic% of Uଽଶଶଷହ) will be much less reactive (prone to fission) than
the enriched fuels (enrichment factors ߳ranging from 2.5 to 5 atomic% of Uଽଶଶଷହ) used in light
water reactors (LWR).
4.2 Fission Products and the Fission Process
The fission process generally produces two light nuclei, called fission products, although three
or more nuclei can also be generated. The relative rate of production of a given nuclide ܫ,
called the fission yield, is denoted by ܻூand satisfies
2,I
IY (111)
assuming that only two nuclei are produced by each fission reaction. As one can see in Figure
14, where the fission yields of all the nuclei resulting from the fission of Uଽଶଶଷହare plotted as a
function of their mass number, the fission process favours the production of relatively light
nuclides ( 90 < A<105) combined with heavier isotopes ( 130 < A<145).Figure 13 Capture and fission cross sections of235

Note that the data presented in Table 7 represent average values, meaning that the neutrons

This fission spectrum for Uଽଶଶଷହis illustrated in Figure 15 . Clearly, most of the neutrons are
released with energies greater than 1 MeV and can initiate fission reactions with fissionable
material. However, the fission cross section for this energy range is relatively low (see Figure
13), and fissions at such energies are highly improbable. Nevertheless, a controlled chain
reaction that relies mainly on fast fission can be achieved in so-called “fast neutron reactors”,
where Puଽସଶଷଽis often used because of its large fission cross section for high-energy neutrons.
The alternative to fast neutron reactors is moderated reactors, in which the fast neutrons are
slowed down to energies where the fission cross section is significantly larger (below 1 eV).
This is the concept used in “thermal neutron reactors”, which are discussed in the next sec-
tion.Nuclear Processes and Neutron Physics 39
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Nuclear Physics – June 2015Now, let us look at the properties of fission products. These nuclides have intermediate
masses and vanishing fission cross sections. However, they can have very large neutron-
capture cross sections and thereby can have a considerable negative impact on the neutron
population in the fuel where they are produced. For this reason, they are often called neutron
poisons. Examples of poisons that have a large impact on nuclear-reactor operation are Xeହସଵଷହ
(ߪ௔= 3.1 × 10଺b) and Sm଺ଶଵସଽ(ߪ௔= 6.1 × 10ସb). A second observation is that most of these
nuclides are unstable and decay naturally through one of the reactions described in Section
3.1. These reactions produce both particles, including delayed neutrons, and energy that is
often deposited in the fuel. These delayed neutrons play an important role in the control of
nuclear reactors, as will be explained in Chapter 5. Moreover, energy will still be produced in
the fuel for a long time after the controlled fission reaction has been stopped, due to the
decay of fission products. This is the main source of the heat produced in neutron-irradiated
nuclear fuels (some energy is also produced through photonuclear fission). This residual heat
is removed from shut-down reactors and irradiated fuel pools by continuously circulating the
coolant.

Finally, we must address the problem of the changes in the composition of a material exposed
to a neutron flux. In Section 3.1, we introduced the Bateman equation, which takes the form

4.3 Nuclear Chain Reaction and Nuclear Fission Reactors
The previous sections have introduced all the concepts required to design a conceptual
nuclear fission reactor:
The nuclear fuel contains heavy isotopes that are broken into lighter nuclides (fission
products) following a neutron-induced fission reaction. Such a reaction also generates en-
ergy and secondary neutrons that can be used to maintain a chain reaction.
Most of the energy released as a result of the fission process is carried away by the fission
products and deposited in the fuel because of the short range of these nuclei.
The secondary neutrons produced in the fission process are fast neutrons.
These neutrons can lose their energy through scattering collisions with the various materi-
als present in our conceptual reactor. Neutron slowing-down by collisions with light iso-
topes is more efficient than by collision with heavy isotopes (see Section 3.5).
This energy deposition increases the temperature of the fuel, which must then be cooled
to make use of the heat and avoid damage to the reactor. For a power reactor, this heat is
collected in a coolant (generally gas or liquids circulating around the fuel) and used to gen-
erate electricity.
Now let us look at the fuel and coolant materials that are the most readily available.
Three heavy fissionable isotopes are present in nature: Thଽ଴ଶଷଶ, U,ଽଶଶଷ଼and Uଽଶଶଷହ. Of these, only
Uଽଶଶଷହis fissile by neutrons of all energies. Because the density of thorium is 11,000 kg/m3and
it has a microscopic fission cross section of 0.1 barn for 1 MeV neutrons, the mean free path of
a neutron for fission in this material is 3.5 m. The mean free path for neutron capture in
thorium is very similar in magnitude. Therefore, nearly half the 2.2 neutrons emitted by
fission in thorium will be lost to unproductive capture. For U,ଽଶଶଷ଼which represents 99.27% of
all the atoms found in natural uranium (density of 18,000 kg/m3), the odds are slightly better,
with mean free paths for fission and capture respectively of 50 and 300 cm and fewer neu-
trons emitted per fission are lost to capture.
The main advantage of Uଽଶଶଷହ, even though it represents only 0.72% of natural uranium compo-
sition, is that its fission cross section is quite high (1000 barns at 0.01 eV), giving a mean free
path for fission of 2 cm. The capture cross section of Uଽଶଶଷହat this energy is also six times
smaller than the fission cross section. It is possible to decrease the mean free path for fission
with Uଽଶଶଷହby increasing its relative concentration in uranium-based fuel (fuel enrichment).
The ratio of capture to fission in uranium-enriched fuels remains small even if the fuel contains
a large amount of Uଽଶଶଷ଼(capture cross section less than 1 barn).Nuclear Processes and Neutron Physics 41
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Nuclear Physics – June 2015The heat produced in the fuel can then easily be extracted by conventional means (by circulat-
ing a fluid such as water). The main problem is to slow down the secondary fission neutrons
to low energies (< 1 eV) while ensuring that few are lost by capture inside other materials or
by leaving the reactor. A neutron slowing-down material, the moderator, must therefore be
introduced into the reactor to serve this purpose.

For this moderator, two questions are of prime importance: what should be its composition,
and where should it be located? The first question is easily answered by combining the kinet-
ics of the neutron-nucleus collision and a survey of the scattering and absorption cross sec-
tions of the most promising candidates. In Section 3.5, we concluded that the slowing-down
efficiency of a nucleus increases as its mass number decreases, which points to the use of light
nuclides as moderators. The most promising candidates are the isotopes of hydrogen and
carbon that are readily available in water and graphite. Table 8 provides the maximum values
of the elastic scattering and absorption cross sections for Hଵଵ,D,ଵଶand C଺ଵଶin the energy range
0.1 eV <ܧ< 0.1 MeV . As one can see, Hଵଵis the best moderator if one does not take into
account its absorption cross section. However, up to one in ten collisions of a neutron with Hଵଵ
could lead to absorption (for 1eV neutrons). On the other hand, even if the number of colli-
sions required to slow down neutrons using Dଵଶand C଺ଵଶis significantly higher (the distance the
neutron will travel between collisions is longer), less than 0.007% of the collisions with Dଵଶand
0.03% of the collisions with C଺ଵଶ(1 eV neutron) lead to capture. Accordingly, if one wants to
build a core that is compact, a Hଵଵ-based moderator is a requirement (light water, for example
in LWR); otherwise the best candidate is a moderator that contains large concentrations of Dଵଶ
(heavy water in CANDU).
Now let us try to answer the question of the spatial distribution of this moderator. Two very
different options can be considered: a homogeneous mixture of fuel and moderator, and small
isolated fuel elements placed strategically in the moderator. Again, the answer to this ques-
tion can be inferred from Figure 13 . The neutrons in a homogeneous mixture of fuel and
moderator materials have a large chance of colliding with fuel isotopes as they are slowing
down. This means that neutrons with energies in the “resonance” range ( 4 eV <ܧ< 10 keV )
will be in direct contact with fuel nuclides. Because their capture cross sections at resonance
energies increase, often by several orders of magnitude with respect to the background value,
neutron capture will have a detrimental effect on the number of neutrons that can reach
energies below 1 eV. On the other hand, by separating different fuel elements by a sufficient
amount of moderating materials to ensure that a maximum number of neutrons escape the
resonance energy range, one decreases neutron loss by capture and increases the probability
of fission.42 The Essential CANDU

pressurized water (PWR) and CANDU reactors. In the next section, we conclude this chapter
by introducing the neutron transport equation, which provides a means to evaluate numeri-
cally the neutron population in the reactor and to determine whether a given reactor concept
can lead to a sustained chain reaction. This equation also provides the neutron flux that is
required to follow the evolution of the fuel and the fission products in the reactor using the
Bateman equation.
4.4 Reactor Physics and the Transport Equation
When designing a nuclear power reactor, physicists have two main objectives:
controlling the nuclear chain reaction;
extracting the energy produced inside the fuel to avoid damage to the core and to use this
energy to produce electricity.
Because most of the energy produced in a nuclear reactor is the result of the fission process,
the power produced in the core can be expressed by:
3 2

whereܸis the reactor volume, ߶(ݎԦ,ݐ,ܧ,Ωሬሬ⃗)is the flux of neutrons with energy ܧand direction
Ωሬሬ⃗at a pointݎԦin space and a time ݐ, andΣ௙,௃(ݎԦ,ݐ,ܧ)is the macroscopic fission cross section
for isotopeܬgiven by
, ,, , , ,f J J f Jr t E N r t E    (119)
whereܰ௃(ݎԦ,ݐ)is the time-dependent concentration of ܬ, the solution of the flux-dependent
Bateman equations (see Section 4.2). Finally, ߢ௃represents the average energy produced by
the fission of isotope ܬ,which we assume to be energy-independent.
Now let us consider the flux, which is a measure of the neutron population in the reactor
(Section 3.5). For a given time interval ݐ݀, the change of the neutron population
݊݀(ݎԦ,ݐ,ܧ,Ωሬሬ⃗) =߶݀(ݎԦ,ݐ,ܧ,Ωሬሬ⃗)/ݒdue to loss of neutrons by collisions is [Bell1982, Duder-

whereΣis the total cross section and ܮ஼(ݎԦ,ݐ,ܧ,Ωሬሬ⃗)the rate of collision per unit volume of
neutrons with energy ܧand direction Ωሬሬ⃗at pointݎԦand timeݐ. This term includes both ab-
sorbed and scattered neutrons. Some neutrons will be lost to migration when the net flow of
neutrons reaching a region in space of volume ݀ଷݎis different from that leaving this same
region. This rate of neutron loss due to migration is given by

of low neutron population (the kinetic theory of gas). Neutron with energy ܧand direction Ωሬሬ⃗
can also be produced in this region of space due to scattering of neutrons with different
directions and energies:Nuclear Processes and Neutron Physics 43

where߯௝(ܧ)is the fission spectrum and ߥ௝the average number of neutrons produced by
fission of isotope ܬ. Neutron productions from other sources ܵா൫ݎԦ,ݐ,ܧ,Ωሬሬ⃗൯can also be added
to the balance, for example, sources for other types of nuclear reactions (photonuclear fission
and photoneutron production in Dଵଶ) or flux-independent contributions from the decay of
radioactive isotopes.
The global neutron population will then satisfy the following balance equation:

which is known as the Boltzmann transport equation. If one assumes that the cross sections
are nearly constant over time (the change in the composition of the materials in the reactor
varies substantially only over long time periods) and that the core is at static equilibrium (the
flux remains constant), one obtains the following time-independent neutron transport equa-

where݇is known as the multiplication factor. It is inserted in the transport equation to
modify the fission rate in such a way as to reach this static equilibrium. When ݇= 1, equilib-
rium is achieved, and the reactor is critical. For ݇< 1, the reactor is sub-critical, and neutron
generation is insufficient to compensate for losses, whereas for ݇> 1, the reactor is super-
critical, and neutron production exceeds losses.
For reactor calculations, where fission reactions take place only inside the core, boundary
conditions of the form
frB,E,
Ω ( )=0 for
Ω×
N<0 (126)
are generally imposed on the transport equation. Here, the point ݎԦ஻is on the outer boundary
of the reactor, with ܰሬሬ⃗being a unit vector normal to this boundary and directed outwards. This
condition simply means that no neutrons will enter the reactor from the outside.
The static transport equation is an eigenvalue equation, with ݇being the inverse of the
eigenvalue. Therefore, the neutron flux is the eigenvector for this equation and is only defined44 The Essential CANDU

withܽan arbitrary constant. For reactor calculations, the normalization constant is directly
related to the power produced in the core.
Solving the transport problem is not trivial, even for very simple cases (static, one velocity
neutrons in one dimension). In Chapters 4 (static) and 5 (time-dependent), approximation to
and simplification of the transport equation commonly used in reactor simulations will be
discussed. One should then be able to extract, from the solutions of the resulting simplified
equations, information useful for the design, operation, and control of nuclear reactors.

6Summary of Relationship to Other Chapters
This chapter explains the structure of the nucleus and introduces the various interactions of
charged particles, photons, and neutrons with matter. It also defines the basic quantities and
concepts needed to study the fission chain reaction and to approach the analysis of reactors.
The Bateman equations are presented and used in other chapters to evaluate the rate of
evolution of fuel composition. The Boltzmann transport equation, which provides a way to
evaluate the neutron population in a nuclear reactor, is also introduced. This is the fundamen-
tal equation from which the neutron diffusion equation used in Chapters 4 and 5 is derived.
Chapter 4 starts with the static transport equation to derive the time-independent neutron-
diffusion equation for the analysis of steady-state (time-independent) neutron distributions
either in the presence of external sources or in fission reactors. It also discusses the evolution
of the fuel composition in an operating reactor based on the coupled solution of the transport
and Bateman equations using a quasi-static approximation.
Chapter 5 covers the time-dependent neutron-diffusion equations and studies the phenomena
of fast-neutron kinetics, fission-product poisoning, reactivity coefficients, etc., in reactors.
Chapter 12 deals with radioprotection and uses the concept defined in the present chapter for
the interactions of charged particles, photons, and neutrons with matter with the goal of
reducing the damage to living tissues.46 The Essential CANDU
©UNENE, all rights reserved. For educational use only, no assumed liability. Nuclear Physics – June 2015Chapter 19 examines the behaviour of fuel after irradiation in a nuclear reactor, particularly its
composition and the residual energy that it produces.
